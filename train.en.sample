Do you wanna call your daddy? Yeah, I wanna tell him I'm okay.
Okay.
Lizzy, be careful of your husband.
I can only lead you to the truth.
I can't make you believe it.
She's calling herself jolene parker.
Elizabeth keen is not your wife, she's your target.
You've been threatening to tell me the truth about my husband
Since the day we met. And I'm ready to listen.
Right now, the only thing that matters Is the immediate threat, your husband,
Finding out who he is and who he works for.
The rest will come.
I promise you.
Asset on board. En route.
12 cc's epinephrine.
Clear.
45 seconds.
We need more adrenaline.
Cover her mouth.
It's okay.
You're okay.
You're okay.
Rest.
You'll be in america by morning.
We're taking you to washington dc.
Do you know where the prisoner was transported to?
Ah, washington. Okay.
Yeah, we'll take care of it.
Very good.
Since when did jolene parker's case Go from missing person to murder investigation? And have you seen my keys?
Crazy, right? Yeah.
What, uh...
What happened?
Police say they have a person of interest.
Really.
Who is it?
What do they know?
They're not sure.
Isn't it possible that she just left town? Like she said, move to dayton?
They found blood.
Matches hers.
You see this stuff every day,
You know, people getting hurt and killed.
And I don't, and it freaks me out.
Just the thought of that happening to you, you know...
Just promise me you're as careful as you can be when you're at work.
The desk. By the computer.
That's where I saw your keys.
I'm gonna be so late.
I'm going to give myself a tardy slip.
Found 'em!
They were under the newspaper.
What would I do without you? I gotta run.
Uh, tonight, for dinner,
Let's check out that new thai place.
He knows something's off.
What makes you say that? I can feel it.
I know him.
Tom is on his heels.
He's behaving erratically.
He killed jolene parker.
You knew?
Why didn't you tell me?
I felt if I told you it would inform your behavior with him.
I found her body, called the police And reported a missing person. I was confident that in the course of their investigation,
They would reach out to you and tom. And they did.
Jolene parker undoubtedly worked for the same organization as tom.
In what capacity, I have no idea.
If they worked together why would he murder her?
Perhaps he was ordered to.
Or perhaps he's just Out of control, irrational.
Paranoid and reactionary.
He's scrambling for a foothold. And therein lies our opportunity, to wait and to watch.
But tom is not the reason I'm here.
I'm afraid there's something quite timely afoot.
The pavlovich brothers are back in town.
You're talking about the team from the bridge That grabbed the general's daughter. They're an extraction team.
Cut their teeth on milosevic's protective detail
During the ethnic cleansing of the yugoslav wars.
We lost six of our men that day.
To the best of our knowledge, The pavlovich brothers have no political agenda.
They specialize in snatch-and-grabs Ranging from kidnap and ransom To extracting political dissidents.
Reddington says he has a contact, A money launderer sourced by the brothers,
Claims they're coming after a chinese scientist named xiaoping li.
What do we know about her?
Eighteen hours ago the agency sent an undercover team To extract her from a clandestine labor camp in the yunnan province. Break her out.
Why?
She's an immunologist.
Specializes in viral and bacterial diseases.
Four months ago she signaled to one of our assets That she had a willingness to talk about a secret weapons program.
A month later she was jailed for treason. She's scheduled to land at andrews in under an hour.
We have a team standing by to escort her to langley for a debriefing.
We gotta assume that the pavlovich brothers already know the route.
Well, then we'll re-route her. Bring her here.
Coordinate the adjustment with langley.
This way.
What's going on?
They said I'd be safe once I arrived.
We have a credible threat you're being targeted.
As a precaution, we've altered our route.
Get up to the chopper.
Donald ressler. Fbi.
Where's the asset?
Ground transport's been arranged. Negative.
Evac's been compromised.
Moving to beta protocol.
Call it in.
All right. Okay, copy that.
Anne arundel county sheriff's department Is reporting a downed aircraft burning two miles outside of crofton.
There's no witnesses on the ground.
We do have units en route.
It's gotta be the dump site on this chopper.
They knew cia protocol.
That if he routes were compromised they'd send in air support.
They snuck in and they're gonna sneak out.
We should coordinate with homeland, get their faces everywhere.
Agent malik, you want to tell me why The director of national intelligence is calling?
What don't I know about this case?
The program li was working on, it's germ weaponry.
Banned by nearly every nation on earth.
It's called whitefog.
The day before she was jailed, xiaoping li sent a message Indicating that she had access to the designs.
If she did, and she shared those with us, That would represent the biggest intelligence coup in a decade.
A germ warfare program?
That's why the chinese can't turn this Into an international incident.
Where are you? Busy.
The brothers.
They took xiaoping li.
How do you know?
Do you have a lead?
Something we can...
Your husband is not in school. Wait.
Where is he?
Meet me at 9th and constitution.
Reddington says he has a lead on the brothers.
Wants to talk.
Let me know what ntsb says about that downed aircraft.
He called in sick this morning.
Returned home briefly before making a stop At the radford bank in adams-morgan.
He's made three phone calls, all from pay phones.
He's been sitting at that cart for nearly an hour.
I'm sorry, lizzy.
Don't be.
This must be difficult.
You wanna know what's hard?
Sitting here when all I really want to do Is get my hands around his throat.
Shouldn't we follow him?
We are.
They all work for you.
Lizzy.
Wait.
Not now.
The boat.
How long for the boat?
No!
No. Please.
Tom? I'm in the dining room.
Where did you get that thing?
I was gonna ask you the same question.
Found it in the basement.
That's where that was.
I'd been looking for it.
My father gave it to me.
It's beautiful.
It's in great condition, too.
Looks almost new.
Why haven't I seen this before?
Your pot is gonna boil over.
I thought we were going out for thai.
Yeah, well, I just thought it might be nice, you know,
To stay home alone.
How was your day?
It was exhausting.
You know billy salter, he was acting up again.
'cause his mom keeps packing these fruit roll ups And they give him this satanic sugar high, you know, so...
Oh. I did stop by the national archives. Just to maybe book a field trip for the kids.
Its funny, I, uh....
I could have sworn that I saw you there.
There was a woman there and she looked just like you.
Ah. No, I wish.
I was cooped up in the office all day.
Should have known.
Well, whoever she was, She could not have been half as beautiful as you are right now.
All right. Keep stirring.
I'm gonna walk the dog.
Come on, bud. Hey, hey, hey.
Come here. Hey, hey, hey.
Where you going?
Come here. Come here.
Yes, you're a good boy. Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.
What?
Nothing.
Love you.
I'll be right back.
Come on, bud.
Come on.
Come on.
Who's a good boy?
You're a good boy. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
How may I direct your call?
Hi, I'm having a problem with my account.
Number's delta, sierra, four, five, one.
Proceed. Mockingbird knows.
Requesting immediate evac.
She knows.
He's gone.
My husband is gone.
Your husband never existed.
Lizzy, I understand why you went after tom today.
The instinct to jump in is...
But it isn't going to serve you well here.
And from the emotional point of view this must feel like An extraordinary violation and betrayal,
But for tom it was business.
Do you know we had sex the other night?
Do you have any idea how filthy that makes me feel? Unfortunately, lizzy, you're chest deep in filth
And you are going to have to wade through it to get to the other side.
I fell in love with him.
I married him.
We were going to have...
I was excited to have a child with him.
He was the one person I chose in my life who made me happy. Who made me feel safe.
What does that say about me?
Everything we had was just a figment of my imagination.
Worse than a figment. A lie.
It was right in front of my face and I didn't see it.
I just
Believed it.
All of it.
Time is the only thing that will allow you to find yourself again.
If you tell me to be patient one more time, I swear to god... I'm going to find him. I'm gonna find answers.
The case.
I need a lead.
Lizzy, if you want to find where the pavlovich brothers are, You need to find out where they've been.
The helicopter is key.
The pavlovich brothers burned that chopper to cover up evidence.
Fingerprints.
Those things might have identified the brothers, but what about the chopper?
The tail numbers were falsified and the chopper was re-painted. That's what they did, but where did they do it?
Is there a deeper forensic analysis we can run?
What particulates were in the heat exchange?
Was there moisture in the compressor?
I'll reach out to forensics.
Analyze every drop of fuel, track every grain of sand.
I want to know where that chopper's been.
That's him.
Sorry, man, not for hire.
Hello, symir.
I'll be brief and to the point.
Yesterday you had a customer, Picked him up outside the national archives.
Sorry, man.
Oh, symir.
You should have taken the money.
Your passenger.
Where'd you drop him?
Ah, calculus.
I can't even think about derivatives Without thinking of that tutor in manor hall.
Cindy something-or-other.
Never wore a brassiere.
Always a bounce in her step.
Look, I'm talking. Cooperating.
You don't need to copy my driver's license, my credit cards.
We want to make sure we know where to reach you, geoffrey p.
Seevers. Should we have more questions.
So, tell me about the book.
I told you, I pick up and drop off.
I don't know names.
I'm the messenger.
What is it, some kind of code?
How many times have you done this?
These drops.
This was the fourth.
I need you to write down the location of each drop you've made.
The pick-up and the drop location.
Oh, my god.
Pagosa springs public library?
I had a water pump go out in pagosa springs.
Bitch of a mountain, wolf creek pass.
Thought I was going to end up living out there with the hill people Until this teddy bear of a man Fixed me up at the local garage.
I'll never forget him.
Tracy woods.
You don't know tracy, do you?
Leather vest?
Mustache?
Tracy woods?
I wonder if he's still fixing water pumps.
Anyway, it will always be a fond memory.
The list.
So that's it?
We're...
What about the package?
You are going to deliver it. Or return it. Or whatever the people you work for want you to do with it.
And as far as you're concerned, We never had this conversation.
Dembe. A copy, please.
I hope you have nothing pressing, this may take a minute or three.
You're sure you don't know him?
Leather vest. Mustache.
Tracy woods.
Shame.
I got something.
Okay, I never wanted to know this much About gas chromotography or gear lubricants, But I think mr.
Reddington is onto something.
Look at this.
We pulled the lab reports from the ntsb And the chopper's engine tested positive for two distinct compounds.
The first is ethephon. Which is a ripening agent for tobacco.
And how does that help us?
Take a look.
Tobacco production's way down in this area.
In fact, since 1998, the federal government Is actually paying farmers not to grow it.
Okay, but there are still plenty of tobacco farms.
I agree. Which brings us to chemical compound number two.
This one is used to grow sweet corn.
So we cross reference the two? Exactly.
We're looking for a pesticide manufacturer
Who used to supply tobacco growers, But made the transition to corn.
And how many of those are there?
Seventeen.
Of those, 11 are outside of the fuel range of this chopper.
Of the other six, Only one has a structure large enough to get that stolen helicopter Out of view and under construction.
Halifax agro-chem.
If I had to bet, I'd say that's their staging site.
It's around the corner, half a block up.
I make seven exterior cameras. Those are the ones they want us to see.
And it's on the list of drop sites I gave you?
How long has mr.
Keen been inside?
I tailed him here four hours ago.
Lovely.
Thank you, preston.
You want me to call sabusawa?
That would be ideal. But he's working an extraction in ecuador.
Then how do you plan on getting keen out of that concrete box?
We have a lead on xiaoping li.
Excellent. Tell me.
We think she's being held at halifax agro-chem in falls church.
We're assembling a team.
Lizzy.
I don't want to talk about tom with you.
You have your opinion on how to proceed and I have mine.
Just don't bother yourself, I'll deal with tom.
Lizzy, I assure you that will yield no answers and little satisfaction.
Well, I'll find out won't I?
I wish I could talk you out of this.
You can't.
Well, good luck with xiaoping.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
I'm raymond reddington.
Get out of here.
Go!
Move, move, move!
We're moving to the cars.
Or an atomic number. Something from a periodic table.
Why do you think that?
Because the only word I know that contains
The letters "vg" together is avgolemono. I don't know what that is. It's a soup.
Chicken stock, egg yolks and lemon juice.
Point is maybe xiaoping li left us a message.
I'll run the letter combination against the dmv registry.
See if we get a hit. Any luck?
I can't get ahold of reddington.
You told him the location where the brothers were holding xiaoping li, right?
Don't you find it a hell of a coincidence
That we show up there, they're gone, And now we can't get ahold of reddington? We've been played.
Red put us onto the pavlovich brothers
Because he knew it would lead him to xiaoping li.
That woman is worth millions.
Where are you going? I'm going to find reddington.
Get some answers.
Reddington, I need you to call me, please. I need some help with the case.
A gift from reddington. Enjoy.
Wasted. Two years we've spent.
On what?
Do you care at all about what you've done to me?
What you've done to my life?
What has it done to you? Who could do such a thing?
Finding you, stopping you...
You'd think I'd be happy you're going to spend the rest of your life in prison.
You think I'd get some satisfaction out of that.
But I don't. Because nothing,
No sentence, no punishment, no revenge Could ever come close to making up for what you've done. I was doing my job.
Your job?
That was our life!
We were going to have a baby.
You begged me to have a baby!
I was doing my job.
Stop talking about your job.
You, this...
Everything was a lie.
My life was a lie. Every feeling.
Every memory.
Say something to your wife who is dying in front of you.
Say something!
It was the shoes.
What does that mean?
That's when I knew.
It was those brown leather shoes.
It was our third or maybe fourth date.
You'd come over to my place on halstead and we ordered, a... Take out. And rented a movie that we never finished because we ended up...
And you had to get up early for work
And by the time I got up you were gone.
I remember standing in the closet... Half dressed. Reaching for my shoes when I saw that you'd drawn this heart
You remember that?
It was the sweetest thing.
And ever since that moment I just felt... Sorry for you.
Because I knew.
I knew that I had you.
Part of me didn't want it to work.
But it did.
Archimedes.
Archimedes!
I beg your pardon? Archimedes' formula.
You know, the naked guy who shouted "eureka!"
Why would she write down a mathematical formula?
Maybe it's some kind of code. A language they don't understand.
Archimedes' principle indicates that the upward buoyant force Which is exerted on a body immersed in a fluid...
Aram.
Um...
Water displacement.
Boats displace water.
She's trying to tell us how they're getting her out of the country.
Contact the coast guard.
Get photos of the brothers and xiaoping li To every port authority on the eastern seaboard.
What are you gonna tell him?
What's going on?
Where are we on xiaoping li?
They're trying to ship her out of the country.
We're combing through the manifests now. Where are you?
Waiting on reddington.
He still hasn't shown.
I'm telling you, keen.
He used us.
These guys, the pavlovich brothers?
You remember what they did.
You were there that day on the bridge.
When we take them down, I want you to be there.
I will be. Just as soon as...
I gonna have to call you back.
Nice try.
I was thirsty.
Where is she?
Who?
Xiaoping li. You took her.
You used the fbi and the pavlovich brothers to get to tom and, what?
Get xiaoping, make some bigger deal? Trade on her secrets?
I have no use for germ warfare.
And as for using the fbi,
I wouldn't be in this relationship if there wasn't a mutual benefit.
Where is she?
I don't know.
I tried to bargain for her life, but negotiations went sideways.
It was all I could do to get tom.
If we don't find her, if she gets sent back to the chinese,
She's going to die.
Tell me what you know.
We think they're putting her on a cargo ship. We're not sure.
We're looking over the manifests, time tables and shipping routes.
She isn't cargo, lizzy, she's contraband.
This is a smuggling operation.
And nothing is smuggled in or out of the chesapeake
Without rolph cisco knowing about it.
Have donald pay him a visit.
What is his obsession with you?
You guys got like a daddy-daughter thing going on?
What's your plan?
Is daddy coming over?
So you gonna make me talk?
No.
I am.
Rolph cisco.
Tell us about the pavlovich brothers.
Who do you work for?
I have nothing to say.
Who do you work for? Liz, come on.
You don't have it in you.
Get me out of here.
Please.
Get me out!
It's okay, it's okay.
Easy, easy.
Come here.
I'm going to put you down.
Easy, easy.
You broke my thumb. Yeah, I did.
If you're looking for sympathy, you might want to start with honesty.
Here's an example of honesty, tom.
You've been making me pancakes for two years. I hate pancakes.
You want honest?
Here's one.
If you're going to handcuff somebody,
Don't break their thumb.
Your handcuffs.
One on the wrist.
One on the banister.
Do it.
I am not here to hurt you, liz.
My job was never to hurt you.
I'm one of the good guys.
Reddington, he's not who you think.
I will find you.
I can prove it.
The key in the lamp.
I know you found it.
Take it to radford bank.
Box number 3929.
He is not who you think he is.
Goodbye, liz.
You want me to stop him?
We'll just let the tail follow him.
Tell me about whitefog.
Whitefog was a black project started by the chinese about five years ago.
You wanna tell me what's going on with agent keen? Sir?
Where was she today?
And don't tell me you don't know.
Was it reddington?
Are there problems?
I think she's having trouble at home, sir.
I lost him.
He's gone.
This whole time you've never let him out of your sight.
Your people are following him now.
They are.
How is this all going to end?
This is an end.
And then something new will begin.
You deserve the best in life, lizzy.
I know that sounds odd coming from a man Who's brought you some of the worst,
But it's the reason why tom Had to work so hard to be that for you.
To be kind. To be thoughtful. To make you laugh.
Because you deserve that.
And it will come.

THE STUDENT OF PRAGUE made film history in 1913 as one of the first "artist films,"
for the premiere of which a score was composed.
The film was exported to many countries and helped establish the worldwide reputation of German silent films.
Sadly, the film only survived in a re-edited version from 1926 and abridged English-language versions for foreign markets.
It wasn't until 1987 that the first attempt at a reconstruction of the original version was undertaken under the direction of Dr Wilfried Kugel.
This new digital reconstruction by the Filmmuseum München is based on the outline by Hanns Heinz Ewers, the original piano score by Josef Weiss and contemporary reviews.
The German intertitles have been re-set according to historical templates.
Judging from the duration listed by the censorship office in 1913 (1,548 metres, 85 minutes), the film is still missing roughly two minutes of footage.
The instances of missing pictures are replaced with short periods of black frames.
Musical prelude and interlude were already without pictures in the original.

Director:
V. Gardine Cameraman:
A. Levitski
Characters and actors:
Lev Tolstoï:
M. Tamarov
Poznichev:
B. Orski His wife:
E. Ouvarova
It was the beginning of spring.
We had been travelling for two days.
We started talking about love.
Poznichev, who had killed his wife under critical circumstances.
I will tell you how that love has taken me to what has happened.
Until I was 30 I lived in luxury, but I was looking for a wife, young and pure beyond reproach.
I returned home enchanted and convinced of her perfect morality. She deserved to be my wife.
I made my proposal to her.
All married this way, I did the same.
Three of four days after the wedding, I found my wife depressed.
There was no dispute, it was a sudden revelation of a gulf that separated us.
The second dispute had especially shown me that its motif was unpredictable.
The children for us were a pretext for fights too.
This is how we lived.
Our relationship became more and more poisoned.
Thus was our relationship, when that man appeared.
I insisted that he came the same evening, with his violin.
They played Beethoven's Kreutzer Sonata.
Terrible, that sonata.
Learning that I had to leave two days later, Groukhatchevski, taking a holiday, said that he considered it impossible to stay with me during my absence.
That was pleasant for me.
Me dearly beloved, We are all well.
We wait for you.
I am very bored.
Groukhatchevski has brought me sheet music and wanted to play again, but I refused.
Yours forever.
The end.
LIVE FOREVER WITH THE CAPITAL

E2 : December 19, 1946
There's nothing to do !
This market has closed.
How long ?
Women of Đồng Xuân market are determined :
No support for France ;
No sales to France !
Why do you ask me like that ?
Women and children had to evacuate, but it is ruined for men to follow them.
If they shoot, leave them alone.
It's not easy to have days like this in human life.
My family has been in Hanoi for several generations, since Đồng Xuân market had just a few sparse huts.
If you live a lot, you will be humiliated a lot, gentlemen.
Therefore, I was so happy when I witnessed brothers punched houses to beat Westerners.
So these sisters ban the market, I'm even happier.
After just one night of their meeting, no one sold to French guys anymore.
Only the most holy Sir Hồ could called the people like that, folks.
Like today, when ladies flocked to the Barracks.
Truly Ladies Trưng-Triệu's descendants !
Could they not be released ?
That's right !
If they don't pay back, it won't be enough for us.
Just one day of our strike and they're already in trouble.
The colonial species only lost food for one day and they were saddened like dogs droopy tails.
If our people don't have vegetables, they will not die.
But if French guys don't have vegetables, they must die.
Well done !
We fight with everything, they will soon die.
We promise each other as heckfire.
But some guys secretly sold vegetables and meat to them.
Is that angry ?
If I catch them, I will tear those illegitimate guys apart.
Are they still opening their mouth at this point :
Monsieur, madame ?
They lost the value of this Đồng Xuân market.
We weren't afraid in the past, let alone now.
Really !
There was a woman who bought fish but without paying.
I climbed up to her house to curse.
I cursed :
How dare she argue back ?
But now there are still guys :
Is that angry ?
That's it !

The suburb is deserted and the late hour favours some dark deeds.
The young girl finds safety in the main street, in the Excelsior Cinema, which still draws in passers-by.
That evening, after endless screenings, the film "Cabiria" had filled the cinema.
The heroic deeds that the brave Maciste performed for Cabiria, have affected the pursued girl.
The following day The following day
The post arrives at ltala Film studios.
Maciste's aperitif
October 1915 Dear Sir, a helpless young girl, pursued by powerful evildoers, dreams that Cabiria's saviour will also defend her.
She will be waiting on the old bridge, next Saturday at 4 pm hoping that, if bravery and goodness are not just screen fiction, she will meet Maciste.
Maciste is tempted by this adventurous task.
Caution suggests Maciste disguise himself as a good-hearted chap.
On the "Old bridge".
She tells her story:
"My father died suddenly, and the house was filled with sorrow.
Then Duke Alexis, my uncle, came."
"My mother was broken-hearted and he became the master of the house."
"One night I heard an anguished cry echoing."
I tried everything, but it was in vain!
It was as if she were mad and would not listen to my accusations."
"I also fell into a strange kind of lethargy, but it did not dim my conscience."
"When I recovered my senses, after many hours, we were already far away."
"A poor fisherman took pity on me and hid me."
"But the villains would not give up.
They still waited and, the other evening, I managed to escape them."
- But why don't you go to the police?
- What would happen to me if I were taken back to my uncle?
The villains sought help from some suspicious characters in the town, who joined together, assisted by an intelligent dog.
The dog.
END OF PART ONE
PART TWO
This wild story seems unbelievable and arouses Maciste's suspicion.
- I don't know how to help.
- I don't have much money on me, but...
- No. Thank you.
"Help me, Maciste!"
"Help me, Maciste!"
The road winds on. The villains realise they are being followed and they thwart their pursuer, by paying off the driver.
Maciste is persuasive, but gets no information.
"The dog reappears."
"If you found the girl, then you can find your master!"
Maciste begins to search patiently once more.
Maciste begins to search patiently once more.

Meanwhile, Duke Alexis, together with the psychiatric doctor, Krauss, hide the other victim.
But the villain who has escaped Maciste comes back to bother him.

The station at the border.
The railway line is out of action.
In order to continue the journey they need to travel to another station far away.
The chauffeur is the only victim of the attack.
But someone we know is traveling on the same train.
When he sees the man he thought was dead, the villain thinks that he is done for and plays his trump card.
"Your mother is held prisoner in the farmhouse in Valdeserta."
A new piece of luggage.
Come to me at once and bring your tools to the farmhouse in Valdeserta.

The prisoner isn't there.
Maciste sees a trick has been played on him.
The young girl is exhausted; only the farmhouse can offer them shelter.

The lady is being held by a certain Dr. Krauss, but I don't know where.
I do know that there'll be a party at the palace on Saturday.
Maciste has a plan.
"On Saturday at 11 pm, we must send this urgent telegram to Duke Alexis."
Another servant will come in useful for the party.

Any 35 mm. Cut of this film seems to be lost nowadays.
Manuel Peña Rodríguez preserved one copy, which was given in the late 60's to the National Arts Fund. In 1971, technician Fernando Vigévano made a 16 mm. Internegative from that 35 mm.
Copy, which was later destroyed. That internegative is currently preserved by the National Film Museum, and it was used for this edition.
The screening speed was adjusted, the colour tones were improved, Also, some intertitles, formerly unreadable due to poor contrast, were also restored.
EVEN AFTER MY DEATH
The City of Silence, where pride and ambition shudder.
Shadows and memories sleep under the peaceful cypresses.
In each gravestone, a story, a name, a date...
If only the most private tragedies of those standing by the graves could be read, too!
Here lies Elvira Meró May She Rest in Peace.
That morning, a man and a child were standing by a humble grave. What a sad memories they seemed to be evoking!
The man was mature. His features and manners revealed his distinguished origins, also the passing of time and the effects of thoughts.
The child was a spring-like portrait of the man.
A string of reminiscence stroke the man's spirit.
In just a few minutes
his tortured mind went through twelve years of memories.
Rosario, 25 september 19...
Dear Carlos,
Please hire miss Elvira Meró,
I've already spoke about her.
She's well educated, and reliable. She's may serve you to works of trust.
She's an orphan and has no friends or relatives.
Your sister.
- You'll be cashing up daily, also putting the money in the safe and handing accounting forms to me.
- This is the key.
- The manager, please.
- Our new cashier needs a place to live - Please, recommend her for some good decent guesthouse.
- Thank you very much.
Luis Rodriguez and Sofanor Garramuño, two medicine students whose night studies obliged them to sleep during the morning.
Garramuño wouldn't want to graduate as some quack doctor, He was almost turning into an old man before graduating.
Mrs. Abundia de Palomeque, the widow of three captains dead during the war against Paraguay. She earned her own living by providing lodging for guests.
They were lacking of wine.
- Add some water to it.
- Enough!
- Didn't anybody give you hygiene lessons?
Dear Mrs. Abundia de Palomeque,
It is with great honor that I hereby recommend
Miss Elvira Meró, our cashier. She wishes to stay at your house, where she will feel as home.
A. Justo.
- You can rest assured. L'll be like a mother, or even like a father!
- This piece of junk won't awake anyone else!
- This projectile was thrown at me from your house.
- Who stays at the higher floors?
- Two students.
But don't get mad, Mr. Justo...
I'll deal with them. Not only they don't pay the rent, They also damage my reputation!
- That projectile was not thrown at the soup tureen, but at my head!
- L'll punish these punks terribly!
The students took position with their own artillery
- If this gentleman insists in molesting this lady, - I'll kick him so hard - that his own family won't be able to recognize him.
Lunch time.
L gladly introduce Mr. Ambrosio Hair to you.
He invented an anti-baldness device.
Its effects are quite remarkable.
Please, see for yourself.
Mrs. Abundia begins taking her terrible vengeance.
What are you laughing about, Mr. Bad Manners?
Starving to death,
Luis and Garramuño must go and find our daily bread.
Appetite has a good nose.
- Do you like candies and pastry, boys?
- We sure do!
- L'll give you lots of them if you call me dad.
- Yes, dad!
Elvira's kindness inspires her to be generous to her two nice and unfortunate fellow guests.
- Chocolate cream and pastry for my little children.
- Get your finger out of your nose!
- You can't hit me! You're not my real dad!
- What are you doing here?
A little help from someone who cares about you.
At the restaurant the check turns to be Garramuño's worst dessert.
- L forgot my wallet at home!
- Please, let my children wait here while I go and look for it.
- Give them whatever they order.
Merriment comes with a full stomach. Garramuño goes to his class.
At 7:00 p. M., Garramuño's children are still at the restaurant, causing great surprise and losses.
- Have your dad forgot about you?
- That wasn't our dad.
- He offered us candies and pastries if we call him dad!
- Another tall story!
At night, back at the guesthouse.
Luis was able to quench his thirst and hunger at a friend's table. Then he met Elvira after work.
- Our family sent us money.
Elvira decides to go further.
Days later... The self-sacrificing instinct, most important virtue in a woman, keeps both students under Elvira's determined protection.
- Do you remember this?
- Haven't your families sent you money again?
- It's late.
We'll walk you home.
The good Elvira walks with them to the University. She makes sure that they actually attend their classes.
Her abnegation makes her be late for work. The indignant manager scolds her terribly
Thanks to his willingness, Luis becomes friend of rich and wise professor Doctor Ximénez.
Months later, this friendship between master and disciple makes Luis a frequent companion at the doctor's elegant table.
Meanwhile, at the humble guesthouse, Elvira gets Luis' clothes ready.
Luis,
I waited for you until 11:00 p. M., when Garramuño sent me to bed.
What a long dinner!
Were you thinking of me while eating?
L left two shirts and six pairs of socks ready for you.
The evening goes on in the luxurious living room. The aristocratic girl, not the orphan
- Congratulate me. L found a bride with a million pesos dowry.
- Elvira was waiting for you. - Seeing that you didn't arrive, she left this note.
The alcohol and the devil are the enemies of good actions.
The alcohol and the typical foolishness of a 20-years-old make Luis conceive a strange criminal idea.
The sleep always stands by the good people, and fell upon this kind soul like a gentle caress.
- What's all this?
- You're not worthy of her kind actions, - or my friendship.
- You're so ungrateful!
Tell her you're sorry!
- Young people get confused.
- One has to be careful, my child.
- Rude boys always get through the first open door they find.
- What an abusing young man!
- L never thought he might do something like this!
Doctor Ximénez pays attention to his daughter's subjective pleading.
- Please invite Luis to my birthday.
He's a really fun guy!
- If that's your wish, I'll be very glad to invite him.
Garramuño and Luis are interns at the Maternity Hospital.
Doctor and surgeon Ximénez gladly invite his disciple and friend Luis to a private dinner celebrating his daughter Maria Esther's birthday, on next saturday.
- Garramuño, lend me 500 pesos!
L need them, I must buy a gift
The hospital has a holly mission, and Garramuño works tirelessly.
Dear Elvira,
I'll have no money for some few days, and I got myself into debt while fulfilling my student duties. L implore you to provide me with 500 pesos, please.
Oh!
A kind cashier like you won't say no!
The bearer of this letter will receive the money.
Thank you.
- L assure you! She took money from the safe! See it for yourself.
- With whose permission
did you get money from the safe?
- You cheated my sister so lowly!
- Forgive me, sir!
Her face burned in shame, her soul was tortured by sorrow. The unhappy woman returned to the guesthouse.
- L have a terrible headache.
She unburdened herself from her sorrow and shame with good old Garramuño.
- We must return that money.
An accusation would be terrible!
- We must help her. She's a good lady. We all make mistakes.
- L bring you the money.
Please, sign this bill for me.
- This will teach you to be a man, not a villain!
The emotions of such a stressful day make delicate Elvira fall ill.
Unaware of all the damage he caused,
Luis returns to the guesthouse.
- L'm so ashamed!
- Don't be. L'll graduate soon, and then we'll get married.
- The man who abuses of a naïve, self-sacrificed woman is not a man! It's a cynic!
This violent rupture with his friend obliges Garramuño to change rooms
There he goes with his things.
In his blind ambition, Luis only cares about that gift he bought at someone else's expenses.
- L feel ill.
Please, fetch Luis.
The triumph of evil.
- This dose is excessive.
Who prescribed this?
- A medicine student.
The tragedy seemed to threaten the house that night, and the night unleashed its own mysteries.
Cured.
Cleaning his friend's messy room,
Elvira discovers a terrible secret.
The sinister idea of death, perhaps a comforting idea in such unfortunate days, came to the mind of this impulsive poor soul.
Luis, fate does us apart.
L wish you can be happy with the woman you love, the woman you abandoned me for. Good bye forever.
Elvira.
At the same time, that other woman prepares herself for a happy night. She doesn't know that she's a rival.
Anticipating his triumph, the drunk, frivolous student dresses up for such a joyful party.
Dear Garramuño, Luis doesn't love me anymore.
L now know that he even made a thief of me to give another woman a gift.
My only wish was to live for him and with him. Given his love for another woman, my only destiny should be death.
My good and loyal friend, this is my final farewell.
Elvira.
Garramuño goes to the police.
L recommend the retention of miss Elvira Meró, argentinean, 21 years old, regular height, thin, white, blond, blue eyes.
Meanwhile...
I recommend the retention of miss Elvira Meró, Argentinean, 21 years old, regular height, thin, white, blond, blue eyes.
The Commissar.
- Look for her at the Palermo woods.
- No news?
Miss Elvira Meró was arrested by agent Ivaldi at 23:30 hours, when she tried to throw herself to the train.
Few months later.
Recommended by Garramuño,
Elvira becomes the governess of a distinguished house.
But soon...
My dear friend, why did you ruin my comforting resolution of that day?
The outcome I feared the most is now becoming true.
L'm having a child and I'm getting fired!
Help me, for God's sake!
Elvira.
The engagement.
Times have changed...
The girls were ashamed of boys before, but not now.
Only in public charity that poor good soul finds help.
Reserve an anatomic bed for me, I have an examination tomorrow.
- She's in God's hands.
One more, life and death meet face to face.
Next day. - She wanted me to ask you to look after her child. - The fact of trusting you
- Do you know who is she?
No, not you!
- Look what you did!
She donated her body to him, and by being good even after her death, she won his heart definitely.
Noticing that he destroyed his life and career driven by madness, and that his behave will make him loose prestige among friends and relatives, the new surgeon decides to pay for his actions and exiles himself.
He sets course to the unknown.
The loyal Garramuño satisfies poor Elvira's last wish.
'Look after the child', commanded him both the dead woman and his own kindness.
And there he was, a complete father, as gentle to the child as a mother could be.
- Don't cry, little boy.
- Tears should not turn into sorrow the joyful dawn of your life, - nor frighten your happiness away, - as mine was when your mother felt in love with another man.
The evocation is over now.
That man was Dr. Luis Rodriguez, who had come back from exile. And his child, now grown up and educated by Dr. Garramuño.
They visited the grave of their beloved woman and pulled the petals off the eternal flowers of memory.

A Sun-play of the Ages _ INTOLERANCE A drama of Comparisons _ ACT I
Our play is made up of four separate stories, laid in different periods of history, each with its own set of characters.
ــــــــــــــــ
Each story shows how hatred and intolerance, through all the ages, have battled against love and charity. ــــــــــــــ
Therefore, you will find our play turning from one of the four stories to another, ــــــــــــــ as the common theme unfolds in each.
Out of the cradle endlessly rocking. ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
Today as yesterday, endlessly rocking, ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ ever bringing the same human passions, the same joys and sorrows. ــــــــــــــ
Intolerance
¶ Our first story...out of the cradle of the present.
¶ In a western city we find certain ambitious ladies banded together for the "uplift" of humanity.
Even reform movements must be financed.
"If we can only interest Miss Jenkins... with her money..."
A little affair is being given by Mary T. Jenkins, unmarried sister of the autocratic industrial overlord... ـــــــ
Seeing youth drawn to youth, Miss Jenkins realizes the bitter fact that ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ she is no longer a part of the younger world. ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
The girl of our story keeps house for her father who works in a Jenkins mill.
With a wage of $2.75 a day, a little garden, four hens, ditto geese, and a fair measure of happiness and contentment.
The little Dear One. ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
The Boy, unacquainted with the little Dear One, is employed with his father in the same mill. ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
¶ Age intolerant of youth and laughter.
¶ "The vestal virgins of Uplift" succeed in reaching Miss Jenkins in their search for funds.
We must have laws to make people good.
There is dancing in cafes. ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
Comes now from out the cradle of yesterday, the story of an ancient people, whose lives, though far away from ours, run parallel in their hopes and perplexities.
Ancient Jerusalem, the golden city whose people have given us many of our highest ideals, and from the carpenter shop of Bethlehem, sent us the Man of Men, the greatest enemy of intolerance.
Near the Jaffa gate.
The house in Cana of Galilee
Certain hypocrites among the Pharisees. Pharisee...
A learned Jewish party, the name possibly brought into disrepute later by hypocrites among them.
When these Pharisees pray they demand that all action cease.
Oh Lord, I thank thee that I am better than other men.
Amen.
¶ Another period of the past.
¶ A.D. 1572... Paris, a hotbed of intolerance, in the time of Catherine de Medici, and her son Charles IX, King of France.
Charles IX receiving his brother, Monsieur La France, Duc d'Anjou.
¶ The heir to the throne, the effeminate Monsieur La France. ¶ Pets and toys his pastimes.
Catherine de Medici, queen-mother who covers her political intolerance of the Huguenots... beneath the cloak of the great Catholic Religion.
Note: Huguenots...the Protestant party of this period.
The great Protestant leader, the Admiral Coligny, head of the Huguenot party.
What a wonderful man, the Admiral Coligny, if he only thought as we do.
What a wonderful king, if he only thought as we do.
The King's favor to Coligny increases the hatred of the opposite party.
Celebrating the betrothal of Marguerite of Valois, sister of the King, to Henry of Navarre, royal Huguenot, to insure peace in the place of intolerance.
Marguerite of Valois.
Henry of Navarre.
Brown Eyes, her family of the Huguenot party, and her sweetheart, Prosper Latour.
Brown Eyes attracts the attention of a mercenary soldier.
Returning to our story of today, we find the embittered Miss Jenkins... aligning herself with the modern Pharisees and agreeing to help the Uplifters.
A diversion of the mill workers. ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
To every thing there is a season... a time to mourn and a time to dance......
He hath made everything beautiful in his time.
The little Dear One having the time of her life. ـــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــ
ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
Miss Jenkins receives a check from her brother for the purposed uplift of humanity. ـــــــــ
Jenkins studies his employes' habits. ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
They should be in bed so they can work tomorrow. ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
And now our fourth story of love's struggle against Intolerance, in that distant time when all the nations of the earth sat at the feet of Babylon.
Outside of Imgur Bel, the great gate of Babylon, in the time of Belshazzar, 539 B.C.
Merchants, farmers, East Indians, with trains of elephants, Egyptians, Numidians, and ambitious Persians spying upon the city.
The Mountain Girl down from the mountains of Suisana.
The Rhapsode, a Warrior singer... poet agent of the High Priest of Bel.
The priest of Bel-Marduk, supreme God of Babylon, jealously watches the image of the rival goddess, Ishtar, enter the city, borne in a sacred ark.
Dearest one...in the ash heaps of my backyard there will be small flowers; seven lilies...if thou wilt love me...but a little.
Ishtar, goddess of love, seven times seven I bow to thee.
¶ On the great wall. ¶ The Prince, Belshazzar, son of Nabonidus, apostle of tolerance and religious freedom.
Replica of Babylon's encircling walls, 300 feet in height, and broad enough for the passing of chariots.
The two-sword man, Belshazzar's faithful guard, a mighty man of valor.
The jealous priest of Bel sees in the enthronement of Ishtar loss of his religious power.
He angrily resolves to re-establish his own god ...incidentally himself.
The gate of Imgur Bel which no enemy has ever been able to force.
Hand maidens from Ishtar's Temple of Love and Laughter.
The Princess Beloved, favorite of Belshazzar, in a room of scented cedar, plated with pure gold, in the hareem of My Lord the Prince.
¶ A love blossom from Belshazzar. ¶ Stricken by her pale beauty, as though by white lightning.
The brother of the Mountain Girl, having some slight trouble with his high-spirited sister, takes the matter to the court.
The first known court of justice in the world. Note: ...
Babylonian justice according to the code of Hammurabi, protecting the weak from the strong.
The Mountain Girl's brother tells the Judge that she is incorrigible.
The judgment is that she be sent to the marriage market to get a good husband.
Endlessly rocks the cradle uniter of here and hereafter. Chanter of sorrows and joys.
¶ Resuming our story of today.
¶ Dividends of the Jenkins mills failing to meet the increasing demands of Miss Jenkins' charities, she complains to her brother, which helps decide him to action.
Order a ten percent cut in all wages. ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
They squeeze the money out of us and use it to advertise themselves by reforming us. ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
Hungry ones that wait to take their places. ـــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــ
Clear the property.
The Loom of Fate weaves death for the Boy's father. ـــــــــــ ـــــــــــ
The exodus after a time of waiting.
Forced to seek employment elsewhere, many victims of the Jenkins' aspirations go to the great city nearby...the Boy among them.
A friendless one...alone...as the result of the strike. ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
So too, the Dear One...and her father. ـــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــ
Fate leads them all to the same district. ــــــــــــ ــــــــــــ
The Boy unable to find work...at last... ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
Adversity causes the friendless one to listen to a Musketeer of the Slums. ـــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــ
And again in Babylon.
¶ The marriage market.
Lips brilliant with juice of henna; eyes lined with kohl. Note: ...
According to Herodotus, women corresponding to our street outcasts, for life the wards of Church and State.
The auctioneer.
Tish tish! 'tis no place to eat onions.
The girl's turn...perhaps not so different from the modern way.
In distant Nineveh... One who would give his life if he were able to buy the merchandise held so lightly upon Love's market.
And man will be happy with this sweet wild rose...this gentle dove.
But touch my skirt and I'll scratch your eyes out!
The temper and rough language of the "wild rose" prove her to be not without thorns.
With her goes a third of a mina of silver.
You lice! You rats!
You refuse me?
There is no gentler dove in all Babylon than I.
Belshazzar now ruling for his father.
Oh, lord of lords! Oh, king of kings! Oh, masu!
Oh, scorching sun of the mid-day, these bugs will not buy me for a wife!
This seal gives you freedom to marry or not to marry... to be consecrated to the goddess of love or not as thou choosest.
The Rhapsode, working in the tenements, to convert backsliders to the true worship of Bel.
Put away thy perfumes, thy garments of Assinnu, the female man.
I shall love none but a soldier.
The love-smitten Mountain Girl vows eternal allegiance to Belshazzar.
In the Love Temple.
Virgins of the sacred fires of Life.
He promises to build her a city, beautiful as the memory of her own in a foreign land.
The fragrant mystery of your body is greater than the mystery of life.
Belshazzar the king, The very young king, of Babylon... And his Princess Beloved, Clearest and rarest of all his pearls, The very dearest one of his dancing girls.
The Dear One in her new environment forced upon her by the Jenkins strike. The same old love and dreams.
The hopeful geranium.
I'll walk like her and maybe everybody will like me too. ـــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــ
In the same neighborhood, the friendless one again. ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
Across the hall, The Musketeer of the Slums. ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
The Boy, now a barbarian of the streets, a member of The Musketeer's band. ـــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــ
Imitating the walk of the girl of the street. ــــــــــــ ــــــــــــ
¶ The Boy's news stand, a blind for his real operations. ¶ Their first meeting.
ـــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــ
The new walk seems to bring results. ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
Say kid, you're going to be my chicken. ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
Pray to be forgiven! ـــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــ
Inability to meet new conditions brings untimely death to The Dear One's father. ـــــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــــ
Out of the cradle, endlessly rocking...
The Comforter, out of Nazareth.
There was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. John ii-1. Note: ...
The ceremony according to Sayce, Hastings, Brown and Tissot.
The first sop to the bride.
Be ye as harmless as doves.
Scorned and rejected of men.
Mary, the mother.
Meddlers then as now. "There is too much revelry and pleasure-seeking among the people."
¶ The poor bride and groom suffer great humiliation.
¶ The wine has given out.
¶ The first miracle.
¶ The turning of water into wine.
Note: ... Wine was deemed a fit offering to God;
the drinking of it a part of the Jewish religion.
Now for a time the little love god works his small but mighty way, in other days the same as now.
Brown Eyes and her family happily ignorant of the web intolerance is weaving around them.
Love's silent mystery.
The mercenary made bold by passion.
In the good old summertime.
For the little Dear One, passing days and youth have healed the wound.
The end of a "Coney Island" day. ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
Nothing doing on the good night stuff, I always go inside to see my girls.
ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
Help me to be a strong-jawed jane. ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
I told you before... I promised Our Lady and I promised father that no man would ever come in this room.
Just for that I'll never see you again!
I was thinking...suppose we get married, then I can come in. ـــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــ
That's me. Kiss me good night and we'll call it settled.
ـــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــ
The enormous sums supplied by Jenkins to be distributed as the meddlers see fit...in "charity"... ـــــــــــــــــ now make the Uplifters the most influential power in the community.
Equally intolerant hypocrites of another age.
And the Pharisee said: "Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners." St. Matthew XI-19.
The woman taken in adultery. ــــــــــ ــــــــــ
Now Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned; but what sayest thou?
He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. ــــــــــ ــــــــــ
Neither do I condemn thee; go thou and sin no more.
Now, how shall we find this Christly example followed in our story of today?
The Committee of Seventeen report they have cleaned up the city.
It is peaceful in the...
No more dancing in...
You yourself were with us when we raided...
When women cease to attract men they often turn to Reform as a second choice.
But these results they do not report: ـــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــ
¶ Each one his own distiller. ¶ Instead of mild wines and beers...
The Boy, strongly braced in the Dear One's sweet human faith, sets his steps with hers on the straight road.
The Boy tells the boss he won't need the 'cannon' any more; he is through with the old life.
ـــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــ
As an example to others of the band, ــــــــــــ ــــــــــــ The Musketeer, with the help of men higher up, arranges the old familiar frame-up. ــــــــــــ ــــــــــــ
The sometimes House of Intolerance. ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
Stolen goods, planted on The Boy, and his bad reputation intolerate him away for a term. ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
The broken love nest... The Dear One... ...alone...

While at the Jenkins home the Uplifters ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ celebrate their success in righting the world that was all wrong. ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
¶ In Babylon. ¶ The High Priest of Bel courts public homage.
The Priest of Bel, frenzied at the worship of Ishtar, prophecies the loss of their souls and the downfall of Babylon.
Belshazzar's father has a red letter day.
He excavates a foundation brick of the temple of Naram-Sin, builded 3200 years before.
Incidentally he remarks that Cyrus, the Persian, Babylon's mighty foe, is nearing the city.
We will begin building your city, oh dove of Ishtar, when Cyrus is conquered.
The Persian camp.
Cyrus, world-conqueror, preparing for the titanic struggle with Babylon, in secret league with the priest of Bel.
Note: ...
Situate between the Euphrates and post road to Egypt.
The treacherous priest of Bel receives assuring news from Cyrus.
In his tent, Cyrus, before the sacred image of the sun.
¶ The institution of Cyrus.
¶ The Medes and Persians at exercises. Note: ...
It was required that each man perspire every day.
Ethiopians.
Barbarians.
Out of the cradle...endlessly rocking, Baby fingers hopefully lifted.
The little wife, now a mother, plans for the day of daddy's return. ـــــــــــ ـــــــــــ
The Uplifters, claiming the regular children's societies are inefficient, now turn to "negligent" mothers. ـــــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــــ
A cold sends our little mother to an old-fashioned remedy, ـــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــ condemned publicly yet used privately by many physicians and hospitals. ـــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــ
The Uplifters investigate.
"Child...evil surroundings...criminal father." ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
Whisky!
We are afraid you're no fit mother... ـــــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــــ
ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
Despite the objections of some of the members, they decide to seize the baby. ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
The friendly neighbor, with a glass of beer.
Did you see that? A man visitor!
ـــــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــــ
We have a warrant to take your baby. ـــــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــــ
Suffer Little Children
Hoping for a sight of her baby.
"Perhaps they are right and baby is happy after all." ـــــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــــ
Of course, hired mothers are never negligent. ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
A new dissipation...watching the happiness of others.
ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
In another bitter day, memorable through intolerance.
The threatening attitude of the Huguenots throughout France is reported to Catherine.
The "old serpent" uses the incident to inflame the minds of the Catholics against the Protestants.
Remember, gentlemen, the Michelade at Nimes when hundreds of our faith perished at the hands of the Huguenots!
And so, our very lives depend upon their extermination.
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth...
Cyrus moves upon Babylon; in his hand the sword of war, most potent weapon forged in the flames of intolerance.
Belshazzar leaving to take charge of the city's defense.
My Lord, like white pearls I shall keep my tears in an ark of silver for your return.
I bite my thumb!
I strike my girdle!
If you return not, I go to the death halls of Allat.
While the Princess Beloved prays, the Mountain Girl goes to fight for her Belshazzar.
Babylon's gates close against the foe.
War drums and trumpets!
On the walls of my city, I, Belshazzar, defy the enemies of Babylon. Allato! Allato!
Allato!
Great moving siege towers covered with ox hide.
Inside the city walls.
Ancient instruments of war.
Rock-throwers, catapults, battering rams, mighty crossbows, burning oil.
Prayers in the temples and burning of frankincense.
Burnt offerings.
Ishtar, beloved, though our sins be many, forgive us.
In our behalf seize thou now the burning sword.
The city assaulted on all sides.
Cyrus, the head of the war machine.
Cyrus repeats the world-old prayer to kill, kill, kill...
and to God be the glory, world without end, Amen.
Help us, Ishtar! ــــــــــ ــــــــــ
Babylon is falling!
Babylon, that mighty city is falling, is falling!
Fight for us! Save us!
ــــــــــ ــــــــــ
The Princess Beloved, frenzied with war's terrors, watches the battle from afar.
Great timbers against the towers.
Into the night.
Fight for him, Ishtar, fight for him!
The women aid.
Morning brings fresh assaults and towers.
Belshazzar's mighty man of valor and his legion oppose the threatening tide.
A new and flaming engine of destruction attempts to burn the towers of Cyrus.
The army of Cyrus repulsed by Belshazzar.
Babylon's paean of victory.
My glorious Belshazzar.
A Sun-play of the Ages _ Intolerance ـــــــــــــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــــــــــــ
In this last act the events portrayed in Babylon are according to the recently excavated ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ cylinders of Nabonidus and Cyrus, that relate Babylon's betrayal by the priests of Bel.
These cylinders describe the greatest treason of all history, by which a civilization of countless ages was destroyed, and a universal written language (the cuneiform) was made to become an unknown cypher on the face of the earth.
In our modern story, The Musketeer, inflamed by a new face wins the unsuspecting little mother's confidence with a promise to recover her baby.
Jealousy. ـــــــ ـــــــ
The Boy's return to The Dear One. ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
¶ The Feast of Belshazzar.
¶ In the great court of the palace, rejoicing over Babylon's victory.
Before the nobles of Babylon, Belshazzar pours out the colossal hospitality of an ancient time.
Note: ...
This hall over a mile in length. imaged after the splendor of an olden day.
A golden moment for Belshazzar and the Princess Beloved.
To thee, oh Ishtar, all praise for the victory.
¶ A gateway of the banquet hall.
¶ The Mountain Girl happy in being even in the fringe of her hero's glory.
The High Priest looks down upon the city he seeks to betray to Cyrus.
They give thanks to Ishtar now, but Oh Lord Bel...tomorrow Cyrus, ـــــــــ ـــــــــ thy servant, shall avenge thee!
The Rhapsode, unaware of the dastardly purpose, is ordered by the High Priest to have chariots at the great gate for a journey to Cyrus.
In the tenement district, a simpler repast ...her last in Babylon.
At the table of Egibi, Babylonia's greatest noble. Note: ...
Following Babylonian custom, the feasting lasts many days.
Spiced wine, made cool with snow from the mountains.
Soldiers, barbarians and camp followers.
The Rhapsode, having completed his arrangements for the journey, turns to thoughts of love.
Thinking only of Belshazzar, her hero, The Mountain Girl leads on the love-sick boy, until  ...as always since the beginning of time between man and maid, boasting, he tells everything he knows.
I know not why we go, but if I don't return soon you can use the password to visit me.
The conspiring priests leave the banquet hall.
Catherine's audience with the King to secure his signature to the order for the massacre of St. Bartholomew. Note: ...
I will not consent to this intolerant measure to destroy any of my people.
After a long session, the Intolerants sway the King.
"We must destroy or be destroyed."
By God's death, since you wish it, kill them all! Kill them all!
Let not one escape to upbraid me.
Prosper and Brown Eyes betrothed. The banns...tomorrow, St. Bartholomew's morn.
Candles out...fading lights.
Prosper puzzled by the ominous activities.
¶ St. Bartholomew's eve.
¶ Upon the doorways of the Huguenots... the chalk of doom.
Prosper's lodgings across the town.
¶ In the Temple of Love.
¶ The sacred dance in memory of the resurrection of Tammuz.
Beloved...a white rose...from Beloved.
The gates manned with their own guards, the priests are guided by the Rhapsode on their mission of treason to the camps of Cyrus.
¶ In the interests of her prince... ¶ A little flirtation.
Suspicious of the hated priests' journey to Cyrus, she uses the password and follows them.
The Musketeer of the Slums seizes an opportune time to visit the little wife. ـــــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــــ
You go in and get the address where the kid is. ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
You know me... I can get your baby for you.
ـــــــــــ ـــــــــــ
Just saw the boss go up to see your wife. ـــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــ
Nearing the end of the Boy's trial for murder.
ـــــــــ ـــــــــ
Love's brave encouragement.
Yes, it was once my gun...but I... I...didn't do it. ـــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــ
The maiden case of The Boy's attorney. ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
I mean...can we hang... I mean, it's only circumstantial evidence. ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
¶ The verdict...guilty.
¶ Universal justice, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a murder for a murder.
Outside the Roman Judgment Hall, after the verdict of Pontius Pilate:
"Let Him Be Crucified"
The Boy's sentence.
Please... Mister Judge...
To be hanged by the neck until dead, dead, dead! ـــــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــــ
The Kindly Officer on the beat learns of the sentence. ـــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــ
The people everywhere are singing your praises.
The irresistible impulse. ــــــــــــ ــــــــــــ
In his distant camp, Cyrus awaits the priests.
The Mountain Girl's bold pursuit.
The day before the Boy's execution.
Feeling the Boy wrongly convicted by some mischance of fate, the Kindly Heart sees a ray of hope in the visit of the governor to the city.
And wondered if each one of us Would end the self-same way, ـــــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــــ For none can tell to what red Hell His sightless soul may stray. ـــــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــــ
The governor unable to give any hope. ـــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــ
At the tents of Cyrus.
The Mountain Girl from a distance watches the priests' arrival.
The great conspiracy.
¶ The Boy's last dawn. ¶ The hangman's test.
ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
Desperate, the little wife herself goes to the governor. ـــــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــــ
Oh God, don't let them do it! ـــــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــــ
¶ St. Bartholomew's morn.
¶ The bell of St. Germain.
The beginning of the massacre of St. Bartholomew.
For Brown Eyes, a terrible awakening.
The Dear One's appeal to the Governor fruitless. ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
ـــــــــــ ـــــــــــ
I did it, I did it!
ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
The attempt to overtake the governor before he reaches the train. ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
Her long wait rewarded, she goes to warn Belshazzar of the new advance on Babylon.
The last Sacrament.
No. 8, after the train, leaps with a new impulse. ـــــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــــ
Intolerance, burning and slaying.
In the doomed city.
"Our marriage will be announced tomorrow."
This bud will blossom...tomorrow.
Beloved, I will begin building your city...tomorrow.
Cyrus sweeps on to Babylon's destruction.
Medici, the old cat, is scratching out the lives of all your people.
¶ At the house of Brown Eyes. ¶ The mercenary's opportunity.
Prosper, with the badges of safety, goes to rescue his loved ones.
Even with the password, Prosper's way beset with danger.
Babylon's last Bacchanal.
Brown eyes...ah me, ah me!
Cyrus unites forces with his lieutenant, Gobryas.
The Mountain Girl's warning delayed by the revelers.
A new appeal.
While Belshazzar doubts, the army of Cyrus enters through the gates left open by the priests.
Belshazzar at last convinced by his own servants.
Belshazzar finds only twelve guards to defend his palace gates against the hordes of Cyrus.
The Princess' vain appeal.
To save Belshazzar the disgrace of captivity, they send him back to his throne.
¶ At the threshold of death. ¶ The farewell.
Honor commands that you go with your king to the death halls of Allat.
To God the glory!
Long live Cyrus, King of Kings and Lord of Lords! ــــــــــ

MARRIAGE LICENSES
In 2004 a tinted nitrate print of Terje Vigen was rediscovered.
From this print a black and white duplicate negative was made in 2005.
The film's original intertitles were inserted into the new negative,   and the colours were recreated by the Desmet tinting method.
Act One.
There lived a remarkably grizzled man on the uttermost, barren isle;
He never harmed, in the wide world's span,   a soul by deceit or guile;
His eyes, though, sometimes would blaze and fret   most when the storm was nigh, -
And now, all I've heard about Terje I'll try   to tell from the first to last.
With land underfoot he was never at ease;   no, better by far then to dwell on the seas,   on the mighty ebb and the flow.
In autumn, when wild-geese were singing south,   he met with their flying skein.
A heaviness fell on the sailor's breast;
Life lay astern with fire and zest, and ahead lay a winter's gloom.
They anchored, and off his crewmen went   with leave for a wild carouse.
He watched them with envy and discontent   while he stood by his silent house.
Indoors there were two bestowed;
His wife sat and span in the peaceful light,   but the crib held a rosy, healthy mite,   a baby girl, and it crowed.
That instant, and Terje's mind, men say, turned sober upon the spot.
He would sing all his happiest ditties there,   where little Anna tugged his brown hair   and lay in his folding arm.
Life ambled along till the year of war   in eighteen-hundred and nine.
The tale's still told of what people bore,   where want and distress combine.
Cruisers from England blockaded each port,   by land there was dearth far and wide;
The poor people starved, the wealthy went short,
two powerful arms were no longer support   with death and disease outside,
Then Terje drooped for a day or two
But his miseries quickly go;
he thought of a comrade, ancient and true:   the sea's great ebb and its flow.
The smallest dory there was to hand he chose for his Skagen trip.
Sail and mast he left home on land, such gear he thought best not ship.
"When winds stopped blustering quite so wild, -
- Terje Vigen rowed for his wife and child   crossed the sea in an open boat!"
The Jutland reef was the devil to clear,   but worse, he'd the English blockade to fear   its look-out's eagle-eyed gleam.
To be continued.
Act Two.
At Fladstrand, reaching there safe and sound,   he gathered his precious stores.
Here was the staff of life to hand;   and his wife and baby call.
The fourth morning, at dawn, by sun's first rays,   a blurred, misty line to scan.
Near home at last; -
That instant the word froze on his lip;
Gæsling's the shoal with hidden top just east of the Homborg sound;
The English officer shouted "stop!" He hoisted an oarbutt, let it drop, and stove in the dory's shell.
"There on the innermost beach ashore watches my wife at our pitiful door   and waits with our baby for bread!"
He dived and he swam and he dived yet again;
In two feet depth all that treasure sank.
They lifted him out and over the side
He offered his sorrow, they sold him their glee
Then Terje fell silent, all hope was past,   he locked up his grief in his soul.
He languished in prison for many a day,   for all of five years, say some
His shoulders rounded, his hair it turned grey   from dreaming about his home.
Then eighteen-fourteen came and with it accord;
A Swedish frigate brought home onboard - - Norway's prisoners, and Terje too.
Back at the jetty he came ashore a pilot by King's decree;
But few recalled in the greybeard they saw,   the youngster who braved the sea.
His house was a stranger's;   and how they fared those two, inside he soon found:
"The husband forsook them, and nobody cared,   they came to the plot that the paupers shared,   in the parish burial-ground."
To be continued.
Act Three.
Years went by, and he kept to his trade   as pilot out there on the isle
His eyes, though, sometimes would blaze and fret,   when the reef to the breakers ran high,
And then people sensed he was troubled yet,   and then there were few who felt no threat   with Terje Vigen by.
One moonlit night, with onshore wind,   there was a stir where the pilots sit
An English yacht being carried in with mainsail torn and jib split.
Close-reached to the weather, a cutter sped
Like a hero he seized on the wheel;
"Preserve us alive from the breakers' roar,   l'll make you as wealthy as wretched before."
The pilot let go of the craft.
His cheeks they went white, and his mouth shaped a sound,   like a smile that at last can break free.
The yacht was broached and ran squarely aground,   his lordship's queen of the sea.
"Abandon the ship!
To the boats, I say!"
"My lord and my lady, stay near!"
To Ieeward he glanced at Gæslingen's top,   and to windward at Hesnes' swell.
He let go helm and the foresail strop,   he hoisted an oarbutt and let it drop,   and stove in the cutter's shell!
"Anna, my child!" she cried out in dread
To be continued.
Act Four.
They grounded and sank, but calmness itself   inshore of the arc of rough seas
"... There'snocausefor grief!" "A sunken dory supplies our relief, three barleygrain casks our dock."
He knew, now, the sailor that on his knee   had crouched on his deck and wept!
"You sailed at ease in your mighty corvette, -
- I rowed in my humble boat."
"I toiled for my own in my forehead's sweat,   you robbed them of bread, and could mock me yet   and over my salt tears gloat."
"It's time for my vengeance to strike, beware!"
"Stand back there, my lord!
One step if you dare,   and your wife and child is the price!"
But Terje's forehead showed peaceful and fair.
"And now Terje Vigen's himself again."
"Like a rocky stream flowed my blood till then;   for I had to - I had to repay!"
"The years I spent in the prison's roar,   they bred my heart's sickliness."
"But now it's over;
we two are even."
When daylight had broken, then all was well;   long lay the yacht in port.
One day milord and lady came by.
"No, rescue came in the nick out there   from this little mite by me."
The yacht then headed for Hesnes-sound, - - with Norway's own flag for wear. He lay to the sun and the winds' keen weight,   and that's why the grass was so stubborn-straight,   but with wild field-flowers between.
THE END
In 1956, Fernando Birri and the Santa Fe Documentary School rescued "The Last Indian Raid" from oblivion. A 35 mm copy, provided by Alcides Greca's family, was screened then.
In 1968, Rosario's Film Society rendered it into a 16 mm copy. The technician Fernando Vigévano was in charge of the project.
Since the 35 mm copy is considered lost, the new restored cut had to be made from the 16 mm version preserved by the Museo del Cine.
According to Film Society member Alfredo Scaglia, and historian Jorge Miguel Couselo, the original cut had several colour tones, something usual in those days.
Those colour tones were lost during the 16 mm rendering, in which only B/W film was used. In order to restore that,
Cousuelo's notes were checked, and also the testimonies of Film Society member Octavio Fabiano, who was able to observe the original film.
Intertitles extension was also improved. In the 16 mm version, intertitles extension had been distorted because Vigévano had to copy almost all intertitles from stills, choosing the most clearer ones.
Some texts, formerly unreadable due to poor contrast were also restored. A new title was made, inspired in the original design, and a likely correct speed for projection was estimated.
THE LAST INDAIN RAID By Dr ALCIDES GRECA
PROLOGUE CIVILIZATION AND THE INDIAN
In 1904 the aboriginal community of San Javier, Santa Fe, after being in touch with "civilization" for half a century, rose up against the white population, thus threatening the lives of the inhabitants of that blossoming town.
A beautiful town called San Javier in Argentina, became better known after this event.
The newspapers widely reported the sad events that took place there.
Nueva Época:
San Javier Indian Raid
Mocovi tribe in terrible conditions 48 casualties, 90 wounded.
La Capital:
The Indians in San Javier
La Prensa Buenos Aires:
Santa Fe State
Mocovi tribe rebellion. Casualties and counded.
La Nacion
Santa Fe Aboriginal revolt in San Javier
Seriousness of the events
Dr Alcides Greca, born in San Javier, author of this historical reconstruction, was a representative of his town in Government Congress.
It won't be the sick poetry imported from Paris, nor the pulp fiction, nor the romance.
It will be the story of a strong and heroic American tribe, which spread legends through the Chaco jungle... Alcides.
Mr. Fernando Centeno, Governor of Chaco,
Former Deputy Dr Ferrarotti and Dr Greca, debate about the script of this film.
Mr Centeno thinks that
The Last Indian Raid was still to come.
San Javier.
Near this town, where the pioneers of civilization built their houses and wealth, the Mocovi people live in terrible conditions.
A centenarian Mocovi woman.
China Petrona and her progeny.
The tribe's old chief, Mariano Lopez
The rebel chief, Salvador Lopez, leader of the 1904 insurrection.
"Don" Desiderio Balcaza, the tribe's "coplero" (poet). He, like Don Quixote, rides a skinny horse.
Juan Saldón, a crazy toba aborigine who does a forward roll, howls like the fox and cries like the "chajá" (Southern Screamer).
The Mocovi, ancient owners of that land, were expropriated. They fish "sábalo" (prochilodus platensis) Using a "fija", a kind of harpoon made of tacuara and a piece of iron or hard wood.
They use modern weapons for hunting macaws, maguari storks and wild ducks that inhabit the nearby lagoons.
They use "bolas" for hunting ostrich, a highly profitable activity given its tasty meat.
They hunt caiman, a dangerous animal that lives in water habitats such as lagoons and streams.
They use a thick fishing line, a spear and meat. The caiman eat the meat through the night.
The Mocovi are farmhands in the local ranches of San Javier.
Moving away.
Roping
Cutting
Taming
"Latagá" (cane) Is the Mocovi's worse enemy. They get drunk at the local "pulperías" (tavern).
The white people pushed them to drink.
Now they punish them and even take them to jail for drinking.
While the Mocovi were living in misery, the tribe's old chief, Bernardo Lopez, was living like a king in the land that the Government had given to him.
Rosa Paiquí, a beautiful half-breed girl, was his loving companion.
Jesus Salvador, the old chief's brother, missed the old days, when he would roam in the woods.
He regretted the day when he and his people were leaded to San Javier by a Franciscan missionary brother.
Who he was secretly in love with.
The tribe's poor living conditions, the hatred he felt toward his brother and his love for Rosa leaded him to dream of becoming the Mocovi's chief.
Salvador visits Bernardo in order to convince him of taking care of the people.
- Bernardo, sleeping all day long;
our people are hungry. Go talk to the Police chief and get our land back.
- I won't make chief Benito angry!
Jesus' generosity left a print in Rosa's heart.
Salvador!
Rosa!
Me, I love you so much! Take this necklace, made of caiman and "yarara" teeth.
Wear this and you will defeat the white and become chief!
I bless you Jesus, our savior!
Act II The Conspiracy
Salvador summons his younger brothers and the tribe's "curacas".
- The reason why I have summoned you is that I am tired of working for the gringos, tired of suffering.
Bernardo is not helping the Indian.
The Gringos have taken our land.
Our people are starving.
Let's kick them out!
Gringos have lots of arms,
Mausers and Winchesters...
Indians only have hunting rifles and spears. We can't fight them!
- Gringos will bring troops from Santa Fe in order to defeat us. Chief Benito is mean. He puts us to jailç if we drink "latagá",
He has forbidden the ball.
The police chief has been taking away our daughters and sisters.
Together we can defeat the Gringos!
Saint Francisco Javier will protect the Mocovi.
The bullets will turn into mud.
The Indian will fight using Indian weapons.
The Gringos will turn into pigs, and the town will be ours.
Their women and houses will belong to us!
Juan and Andrés are cowards, just like chief Bernardo.
They fear the Gringo.
Salvador is not scared.
If Salvador becomes the chief and kicks the Gringos out, I will be his woman.
You will be chief Salvador's wife, and the Gringo's daughters will be your servants.
The chasquis (messengers) Were quickly sent to Santa Rosa and San Martín in order to spread the news about the upcoming revolt.
Several aboriginal families immigrated to San Javier in a two year period. Strange ceremonies were held at night...
Each Indian swore to be loyal to the Mocovi cause and to keep the rebellion a secret. They left an amulet in the chapel, the same they would wear the day of the battle.
Those Mocovi, who were still loyal to chief Bernardo, took care of his affairs.
The tribe's spies kept a close look on the enemy's activities the white people from San Javier enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle without noticing that a tempest was about to start.
Meanwhile, in a hidden corner of the region,
Jesus Salvador was proclaimed chief by the tribe notables.
Love affaires, Balls and Religion.
The day of the uprising was approaching and that year the Mocovi pushed the boat out to celebrate San Javier's day.
The procession.
The Mocovi carry their Saint to the church.
The Mocovi celebrated through five days and nights. The executed their traditional dances: "Sarandí", "tontoyogo",
"bravo" and "cielito".
The fellows took a chance to dance with the ladies.
The dancing partners
Those that broke that rule were tied to a pole.
They were bailed out if they paid in money, cigars or alcohol.
The Mocovi sang amusing and kind of melancholic tunes, though they were not refined.
- Mr. San Javier! Mr. San Javier!
Pray for us, the poor ones...
Us, the poor ones!
Turn around again, Cenciona Valdé.
The turn you have made, you've made it in reverse.
Long live Santa Rosa!
Dance, dance Sinforosa.
Stomp your feet fellow.
Stomp your feet like the chestnut horse does...
Your love affairs are like a yoyo. Like a yoyo.
Sometimes they improvised for the local tycoons' amusement.
- Mr. Pancho Troco.
Mr. Pancho Troco.
Buy us some gin.
Have a drink.
Rosa, who had been forbidden to dance by the chief, remained seated among the old ladies, absorbed in sad thoughts.
She rejected many gentlemen that had invited her to dance.
But she couldn't resist one, who didn't care about Bernardo's orders.
Bernardo sees that his orders were not obeyed.
And forces Rosa to comeback home.
- You were dancing with Salvador, that thief!
Don't insult him!
I'll teach you!
The next day, two of Bernardo's men took Rosa to a faraway corner in the islands.
Rosa was kept in there for several weeks, in exile, thinking about Salvador.
Ananoque, one of Salvador's loyal helpers, had tracked her down.
Every night, while the guardians were asleep, Ananoque visited Rosa and told her about Salvador and his plans.
Chief Salvador sends this ceibo (national flower of Argentina) And cochiyo for the day. I'll keep you up to date.
Act IV. The regression
The Indians had started to go back to a more primitive stage.
They had moved away a large amount of stolen cattle to the islands.
Several farmers were killed in their own land
Not even the bullets could hold the hungry of Mocovi back.
The land owners and farmers constantly complained to the Police Chief.
The Mocovi, who prefer mare meat over any other kind, would not miss a chance of satisfying their appetite.
Many Mocovi were arrested for committing such crimes.
This reprisal urged Jesús Salvador to quickly gather together all his followers.
Juan and Andrés, Salvador brothers, were planning to murder chief Bernardo.
Bernardo found shelter at the Police Station.
Meanwhile, the people in the town became aware of the imminent danger.
Women and children panicked.
April 21st, 10 am. Tension between people in town and he Indian was growing fast. The battle was about to start.
The sky over San Javier turned threateningly black, and a tempest broke in the islands.
Rosa hears the ostrich booming. It was the sign she was expecting. The rebellion had just started, and she decides to act.
I've hurt my hand.
Bring some water from the well.
There you go!
So you won't be cheating on Bernardo again! Evil woman!
Act V
Chief Benito reacts to the Mocovi attack.
At noon, the Mocovi interrupted the communications by cutting the telegraph wire.
The Governor of Santa Fe received the following message.
"Thousands of insurgent Indians... "
This telegram and some other alarming rumors reached the Capital city through different via. The newspapers reported out the terrible events.
News received from different places confirms Mocovi Indian uprising in San Javier.
Town inhabitants were slaughtered. Last telegram received at the Government says: "Thousands of insurgent Indians... "
Personnel are assumed dead when going...
They are attacking the town.
Meanwhile in Santa Fe, rumor had it that the storm hadn't have started yet in San Javier...
Gaucho Feliciano Luna went to see the Mocovi in order to claim the horses they had stolen from him.
Hey you, chief of thieves, give back the horses you have stolen from me.
- Indian did not steal any horse, old Luna.
How dare you!
Thief, give back my horses, otherwise I will...
They are going to kill Luna! Fire!
Five minutes later.
The town was besieged by the raging Mocovi for two hours.
The battle ended. The tribe had been defeated.
San Javier's brave youths went after the fugitives.
The wounded Mocoví hid in the rushes and tried to heal their wounds.
That night, in the ranches... The neighbors set the Mocovi campground on fire.
Act VI Chasing the indian
Several groups went out to watch out the surroundings, where the Indians had supposedly committed terrible crimes.
The defeated Mocovi ran away toward the islands, heading the Gran Chaco, avoiding the northern towns.
One group of rebels remained standing. Commanded by Salvador, they had changed their objective. They couldn't conquer the town, but they would capture Bernardo.
The old tribe chief was away from the anger of the Mocovi.
The police dismantled the group of rebels. Jesús Salvador and his loyal Ananoque managed to go in San Javier in order to reach the islands.
At the sunset, the two Mocovi, living symbols of defeat, approach shack where Rosa Paiquí was kept prisoner.
That poor half-breed girl was still tied to the post.
All of a sudden, an awful scene took place in front of her sad eyes.
Salvador!
The Police!
The loving couple, hiding in the shadows of the night, managed to get rid of their chasers. They were heading Gran Chaco, the land of the Indian, taking unknown routes on their way.
Epilogue
Once there, in the land of high breakaxes and noble palm trees,
Jesus Salvador was the chief of Rosa Paiquí's heart.
The restless Indian, who fought against civilization, took from it its sweetest legacy:
The kiss, which was unknown to his people.

You don't have to worry about me."
"My name is Kári."
"I come from the south, looking for work."

ACT TWO
Kári was like a man in a fairy tale.
He fell down a deep well, thinking he'd never see the sun again.
But suddenly he was in a green field and there was a castle...
And the king's daughter walked towards him...
"I thought you could have this quilt for your bed."
"If I was a widow and owned a farm, maybe you would treat me differently!"
"That big a farm doesn't exist in this country."
In the county church on a Sunday in the late summer.
"Who is that man?"
No one can escape their destiny even if they run faster than the wind.
"That man is not Kári!"
"That is Ejvind from the hills down south."
"A few years ago, he was the one who..."
"Are you sure your eyes don't deceive you?"
That same Sunday, there was a harvest feast at Halla's.
"When you laugh, your hair rides up your brow."
"If you have something you need to hide, keep your eyes and ears open.
You have an enemy."
"I was not aware that I have vexed anyone here."
"Your very existence is enough to make enemies."
"As of today, Kári is the foreman here on the farm!"
"Obey him as you would obey me!"
"I wish to speak with you in private."
"Today I got some news, and as your brother-in-law,
I see it as my duty to inform you."
"A man from the south is staying with me, and he recognized your 'foreman' as a thief named Ejvind.
I wanted to let you know so you can be spared any embarrassment and get rid of him."
"I think I know why you are spouting accusations against Kári."
"But you'll never make me believe that he's a thief!"
"Come outside and tell him yourself if you dare!"
"This man says your name is Ejvind and that you are a thief!"
"What is your response to that?"
"That's a lie!"
"You come here to listen to untruthful accusations!"
"I'll give you something more entertaining than that!"
"You'll see how a man like Kári treats a mean backstabber!"
"The county sheriff will have to fight the one he calls a thief!"
"You're crazy!
An honest man will not fight a thief!"
"The sheriff says he won't fight a thief!"
"He's just trying to get out of it!
He's a coward!"
"Björn Bergstéinsson has never been called a coward before!"
END OF ACT TWO
ACT THREE
"Kári will be back in jail before sunrise!"
"Give me your hand, Kári, and tell me you're innocent."
"You don't believe me either."
"Tell me you are innocent!"
"In this matter, I am innocent."
"I'm so happy to know you are innocent!"
"I'm so glad, I could kiss you!"
"Kári!
Will you marry me?"
"Halla!
I can't!"
"Are you married?"
"No."
"I didn't think that your eyes could lie to me."
"You should go."
"My eyes haven't lied..."
"I knew a man by the name of Ejvind..."
"He was poor and had many children."
"They often went without food."
"Ejvind went to the priest to borrow some food."
"He offered labor in exchange, but the priest wouldn't help."
"There was a snowstorm and it was late at night."
"Ejvind went past the priest's sheep pen."
"Temptation got the better of him."
"The snowstorm would cover any tracks..."
"And the priest was wealthy enough.
I hated him!"
"Late at night, Ejvind arrived home with a large sheep."
"The next day..."
"...a message arrived from the priest."
"They found his mittens in the sheep pen."
"They said they could prove he had stolen many times before."
"He was sentenced to ten years in jail."
"My name isn't Kári!"
"It's Ejvind!
I'm a convicted thief!"
"I escaped..."
"...and lived like an outlaw in the hills by the warm springs."
"I have lost my faith in mankind..."
"Do with me as you please.
Kick me out of your house."
"Turn me in to the authorities."
"But you have to forgive me."
"It was poverty and the snow that made me a thief."
"I don't want to cry.
Crying is ridiculous!"
"Stand up!
I am not a God from whom you should ask forgiveness."
"There were many times I wanted to tell you the truth, but it became harder with each passing day."
"I never understood why until now..."
"...but now I understand and now I can tell you."
"Kári has loved you..."
"You are the only woman he's ever loved."
"But Kári is no more and has never been more than a poor man's dream."
"He's loved you for a long time, but has never seen your beauty until now."
"Like a blue hill, rising from the mist."
"Close your eyes, Kári, and sleep a moment longer."
"Kiss me!"
"I want to sleep with my eyes open..."

ACT FOUR
"So, you see, there is no doubt in my mind that my sister-in-law's foreman is the escaped convict
Ejvind of the Hills.
You need to arrest him immediately!"
"Where is Kári?"
"You shouldn't have to suffer any longer on account of me!"
"I will turn myself in!"
"We will find him!
He will not be free for long!"
"Thank God, they are gone!"
"I have to leave very shortly."
"I've asked Arnes to help me."
"When the sky is red in the morning, I will be far up in the hills."
"God bless you, Halla."
"Should I ask you to marry me a second time?"
"I thought we were married!"
"In God's eyes, we already are!"
"In that case, isn't it customary for a wife to go with her husband?"
"Will you be my wife and follow me through all suffering?"
"Yes, I will!"
"You can't run away with me, Halla!"
"You don't know what kind of life that is."
"And you'll forever be called a thief-- like me!"
"You're such a child!"
"If I can't marry you, I have to marry the county sheriff!"
"You're so beautiful!"
"All our time together is reflected in your face."
"Your soul lives in your eyes."
"When you look at me, I feel an invisible hand caress my face."
"Tonight, we will ride together towards the hills!"
"House, home and honor-- she gave it all up for him."
"They reached the plains in the early morning."
"Onwards and upwards!"

ACT FIVE
They had lived like outlaws for five years, hunted like animals.
But they were the rulers of the hills!
Everything they could see belonged to them.
When the sun hits the edge of the glacier, you see the most beautiful colors even though it's colorless and full of mud and ice.
Love was the sun in their lives...
"...and now I'm an outlaw, too!"
"I've lived in the hills alone for two and a half years."
"When she arrived in this world, the sun was shining and the sky was warm and blue."
They never felt alone.
They were kindred spirits.
There was a wasteland in their souls.
"I will tie you now, Tota, so you won't fall in the river while I do laundry."
"The sun is high in the sky already."
"I better take this to Halla before we go on."
"What do you say we go around the falls and try our luck getting to the lake on the other side?"
"I think you were more scared than I was!"
"Your whole body is trembling!"
"There are human tracks here!"
"Don't tell Halla about it.
She'll just worry."
END OF ACT FIVE
ACT SIX
God is sometimes far away, but the judgment of man is always near.
"It's not impossible!
It could be Ejvind of the Hills and his cohorts!"
Love can make one person good and the other one bad...
"I'm going to the river to wash up."
"I need to get this sweat off my body!"
"You should have a talk with Arnes."
"He's more depressed with each day.
I think he wants to leave."
"Tell me, why should some men be happier than others?"
"Kári has been happy for seven years."
"One time when you were ill, I gave you some green shoots."
"They had just sprung out of the snow.
And you kissed me."
"Is your soul at peace now?"
"May I kiss you on the mouth?
Just this once!"
"Your lips won't hurt from it!"
"I gave my husband everything-- including my conscience!"
"I don't know what came over me.
A devil dwells inside me..."
"I love you..."
"I understand now that I have to leave."
"I can't stay with you two, and I can't live alone."
"I will return to the people, and they can do what they want with me."
"Farewell, Halla."
"I will think of how lovely you are when I'm in jail."
"Someone's coming!"
"There's eight of them!
You have to run-- don't waste any time!"
"I won't leave Tota!"
"It's too late!
There's three of us against the eight of them!"
"You have to give the child to them!"
"Get them!"
"It's Björn!
I won't give my child to him!"
"You devil!"
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
END OF ACT SIX
ACT SEVEN
After a long life together, desperate times struck.
It was a winter night so bad, the grass trembled in despair.
Starvation tore at the bonds the years had built up.
"Close the door!"
"This storm has lasted for seven days."
"Do you think it can last much longer?"
Hunger came to them in their dreams with sizzling meat that demanded their love as payment.
"We promised each other not to speak of food!"
"I want food! Food!"
"Shame on you!"
"Don't you think I'm suffering as much as you?
But I'm silent!"
"You made me stay here!"
"If we die of starvation, it's all your fault!"
"Who did the stealing?
Was it me?"
"You're ugly."
"I never saw it before.
Your face looks like a dead horse's head."
"Is your hair coming out?"
"I thought you were the only person that understood that I couldn't help what I did."
"Are you leaving?"
"I beg you, please.
Stay.
For my sake."
"We've lived together for 16 years.
We ought to die together."
"You were happy once when I ran away with you into the hills."
"You carried me across the rivers until I was strong enough to wade through myself."
"All the nights we slept under the stars!"
"Every morning we felt on our face was like a blessing."
"You kissed me and said you loved me."
"I would rather you kill me before you go!"
"Stab me with your knife here."
"I won't scream."
"It will be like a bite from a breastfeeding baby."
"And one of his disciples asked:
'Teach us, Lord, how to pray just as John taught his disciples.'"
"He said to them, 'When you pray, say:
Father, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come.'
'...for thine is the kingdom and the glory forever and ever.'"
"Amen."
"I once had a dream about two people."
"Their only law was their love."
"After a long life, they came into hardship."
"They looked into each other's eyes and went out into the snowstorm to die together..."
"It's one's duty to live as long as possible!"
"You don't love me anymore.
You've never loved me."
"Will you get some more wood?
I'm cold."
"God Almighty!"
Death brought them absolution...
Their one law was the love they shared.
THE END
A DAY'S PLEASURE
The family off for a rattling good time.
Everybody's doing it.
All fixed up for the boat ride.
Children in arms free.
All aboard.
"I'll see you later."
Three minds with but a single thought.
"Ham sandwiches -- buttered popcorn -- cigars - cigarettes."
A forced acquaintance.
The hold-up at the crossroads.
"Will you kindly get back to where you same from."
"Stupid ass!"
Tar.
"How you have changed."
"You have been sticking around here long enough."
The end of a perfect day.

Act 1
At the time when Aslaug became a grown-up girl, there was no much rest at night to be had at Huseby. ...as the most handsome boys in the village both wrangled and fought night after night.
The nights before Sunday were the worst.
Thormund, the wealthiest farmer in the village
- Hjalmar Peters
Ola, his son
- Kurt Welin
Courage, my boy!
I have talked to Knut Huseby, and you will receive a warm welcome.
Knut Huseby
- Theodor Blich
Aslaug. Knut Huseby's daughter - Gull Cronvall
You don't seem to succeed much better then the rest of us in pleasing the Huseby wolf
Sigurd and Oivind, Huseby's sons - Hugo Tranberg and Gosta Cederlund
Since I've been given a daughter, I'm obliged to protect her, boys
You are so right, father.
Whoever makes his way here will be saluted by me
Should we baptize him?
There you go!
I think you dampened his burning desire.
Tore Naesset was only a smallholder's son, but was nevertheless reputed ...to be the one who most frequently visited the Huseby farmer's daughter.
Darling, come what may, tomorrow I will speak with your father.
Tomorrow I will follow you to Huseby and propose in Knut's presence.
On Sunday, after Tore had escorted his mother home from church ...he set out to address Huseby, just like he had promised Aslaug. - Hilda Castegren
No, no, my lad, don't even think of such haughtiness.
You, a poor smallholder's son, could never get the daughter at Huseby.
I most certainly can, little Mum.
It's plain to see that these two suit each other well.
Although the girl is a little shy, of course.
Is your father at home?
You, Knut Huseby, are a wealthy man, and I myself am no church mouse.
You have many children, and I only have this one son.
What if you gave my son your daughter's hand in marriage?
It seems a fair offer, but in this case my daughter will have to make her own decision.
Go out and find Aslaug, Sigurd.
Father wants a word with you, Aslaug, and he won't be pleased to know ...that you stand here wasting time with the smallholder boy from Nesset, ...when a bloke like Ola Thormundsen has come to propose to you.
It so happens that Aslaug and I have loved each other for a long time.
I have come here to ask for her hand.
If I can't have Tore, I will not spend another happy day in this world
As yet, there is no tradition here on Huseby for farmers' daughters ...to share the marriage bed with smallholders' sons.
Nevertheless, that day is likely to arrive.
The end of Act 1
A DANGEROUS PROPOSAL Act 2
A few days later.
Aslaug brought the cattle to the summer pasture.
The next Saturday night.
Only one road led to the Huseby summer farm, and it passed right by the main farm.
Would you believe that boy!
He seems to be heading for the mountain farm!
God's peace on the summer farm!
God's peace to you too.
It's just not right that this smallholder stud should be allowed up at the Huseby summer farm.
Well, if no one else can keep him at bay ...I guess me and my sons should give it a try.
I may still possess some talent in that direction.
Come on, boy, let's have a bout!
Enough for today, fiddler!
Come back soon, and I'll give you some more!
Don't forget your fiddle when you come to our wedding.
A lazybone like you will have to accept whatever comes his way.
While Aslaug faithfully yearned, Tore approached the Huseby farm.
If next Saturday you manage to slip past the Huseby wolf and his cubs, the girl will be yours.
The end of Act 2
A DANGEROUS PROPOSAL Act 3
A few days passed.
Since Tore visit to the farm, there had been no news from the valley.
What do you want, my lad?
How do you do up here, Aslaug?
You are probably a bit lonely now that Nesset cannot come here anymore?
Yes, he got what he deserve.
We fixed him up so well last Saturday night, ...that he's probably lost all desire to go courting again at the Huseby mountain farm.
Come next Saturday.
Tore was fit again, although not in such high spirits as he used to be.
If next Saturday you manage to slip past the Huseby wolf and his cubs, the girl will be yours.
In the worst case, I'll get a good beating!
We're just here to make sure that the smallholder boy from Nesset stays away from the summer farm tonight.
Yes, we would like to join you.
Position yourselves two at every hill.
If he approaches, whistle!
I bet Ola would love to go to the mountain farm himself tonight.
The two of us as well.
The girl will finally have to give up ...because the engagement will be broken off tonight.
The boys will stand guard down here.
The end of Act 3
A DANGEROUS PROPOSAL Act 4
It was on a Saturday evening. I had been awaiting you.
You promised me to come, but your promise proved untrue.
Where could you find a rose where no rose ever grows?
Where can true love be found if your sweetheart lets you down?
God's peace on the mountain farm!
God's peace to you too!
That fellow is worth having.
The girl shall be his.
The shimmering summer air hangs over Hardangerfjord.
Against the sky in bluish hue the mighty mountains loom.
The glacier shines, the hillsides are green.
The clime is clad in its finest attire.
And behold!
Over green, clear waves a bridal procession sails.
The end.
MADAME BUTTERFLY after the world famous opera in 6 acts.
Characters:
Tokuyawa, the daimyo O-Take-San, his daughter The Bonze Karan, the temple servant
Karan, the temple servant Kin-be-Araki, the teahouse keeper Hanake, O-take-San's servant girl Olaf J. Anderson Eva
Tokuyawa, the Daimyo travels from Europe back to Japan.
O-Take-San, his daughter
"Father, I am so happy that You have returned ---- during Your absence I had to suffer so much from the Bonze!"
"O-Take-San, your father has brought this for you from the foreign lands."
The Bonze.
Karan, the temple servant.
"Noble Lord, Your servant is guarding the Holy Shrine from the trampling of foreign feet!"
"May Buddha bless Your return!"
"You have taken many foreign things to Lippon again."
"I noticed from the gifts for Your daughter."
Olaf J. Anderson.
...So, in a couple of days O-Take-San will become priestess in the 'Holy Forest'...
"If my child wants to - I shall not force her!"
"You have lost your faith in Buddha in those foreign lands!
Fear his wrath!"
"That awful Bonze persecutes me, because I have perceived his unclean purposes...
but I will pray to Buddha myself...
and Buddha will hear O-Take-San!"
"Forgive Your poor servant, who is not worthy to be Buddha's priestess... but who wants to sacrifice to the Noble One her greatest and dearest treasures: her puppets."
"Buddha will make sure that You are punished."
Three weeks later the festival of the 'Falling Leaves' is celebrated.
'May Buddha bless you!
The Mikade, his name be praised.
Thanks You for Your message about the traitorous Daimyo, who, with foreign doctrines wants to incite the people against the sanctified person of the Mikado.
The rebellious one will not escape his punishment...'
"An envoy from the Mikado awaits You, master!"
"The noble Mikado sends You this gift...
You know what it means...
within 24 hours You must bid life farewell!"
"A gift from our merciful Lord, the Mikado.
A sign of his mercy!"
"Go into the garden, for our guests are missing You!"
"O-Take-San has something to tell You!"
"The Daimyo is dead!"
"As final sign of his devotion to the Mikado, he gave him his life."
"That is the palace of Daimyo Tokuyawa, he is a favorite of the Mikado and his house is one of the most hospitable in Japan."
"Your father was punished for your sins by Buddha.
Don't change your mind, Buddha is strict, so serve him as priestess."
"Behind this wall lies the 'Holy forest', where no European may enter!"
"Prepare yourself for it, O-Take-San, in a couple of days your initiation as priestess will take place."
"How did You get here, stranger?
Don't you know our strict laws?"
"If You don't want to fall into the hands of guards You should leave quickly!"
"Come tomorrow at the same hour..."
"O-Take-San would be a very good Geisha for the keeper of the Teahouse."
"....a normal garden...."
"I cannot follow You, for soon I will be consecrated as Buddha's priestess."
"...in the evening".
"Come quickly, O-Take-San, I want free you, but promise me you will be quit!"
"Olaf, you changed a lot.
Come with us to the Teahouse!"
"A new geisha!"
"If you pay well, I will bring you the most beautiful geisha in Nagasaki."
"Noble chief, You can only keep this geisha if, according to the laws of the Yoshiwara, you marry her for 999 days.
You have, however, the right to divorce her, whenever you want."
"I am willing."
The next morning.
"Karan!"
"Where is O-Take-San?"
"Bring me O-Take-San, or I.."
Some time later.
"I can't approve the marriage of Olaf Anderson with that Japanese girl, for it won't be long before we return home!"
"Holy Priest, after much effort I've found O-Take-San.
She is married to a foreign marine officer and lives in the Teahouse on the hill."
"Be cursed, an unfaithful one."
The weeks later.
"I went to collect my inheritance..."
"This illustrates the three virtues of Japanese girls!
They may hear nothing, speak nothing and see nothing."
"This is the sword with which my father killed himself, by order of the Mikado!"
"You shouldn't put so much faith in your happiness, O-Take-San...
it could change quickly!"
"Olaf will never leave me..!"
"My dear Olaf, it is not nice of you, to make your little wife sad."
"That little O-Take-San seems to really love you!"
...and when the Honeymoon was over...
"Greetings O-Take-San, don't be sad...
I am travelling back to Europe, but...
I will return!"
"Come back swiftly Olaf...
You do know... that you...
must come back!"
The memories of the land where the peaches grow.
...some little geisha somewhere...
"Little Olav, repeat after me:
Great Buddha, grant me my wish and make O-Take-San happy again!"
Lord Matahari.
"In four weeks it will be four years ago, that O-Take-San's husband left her.
According to our laws, she will be free again then, and must return to the Yoshiwara!"
"...and if she has no money to buy herself free!"...
"I want to know immediately where O-Take-San lives!"
Dear Olaf!
You probably still remember that little geisha, who you married years ago.
The poor creature has taken the affair very seriously, and has been waiting all these years with her child in tender longing for you...
"O-Take-San lives with the keeper of the Teahouse, Kin-Be-Araki!"
"The Bonze wants you to ask her for the rent for the room...
if O-Take-San cannot pay...
she must remain in your Teahouse!"
"That stranger paid for three years, O-Take-San has been living here with me for four years now and if does not pay the rent, she must leave this house immediately."
"I have nothing, but my husband, Olaf Jens Anderson, will be back soon, and then you will certainly get the money!"
"In my department I will not allow the oppression of the poor!"
"You won't be bothered by that Landlord again, take this money!"
"O-Take-San is beautiful...
and I don't want her to lack anything!"
"Today I got the order to set sail for Japan. Would you like to come along?"
...and when the peach trees were in bloom again...
"O-Take-San, an emissary from Lord Matahari awaits you!"
"I love you, O-Take-San, and if you want..."
"O-Take-San, would be my wife?"
"I do not want your wealth.
I am the wife of Olaf Anderson.
I'd rather die than be unfaithful to him!"
"You are mistaken, O-Take-San...
Olaf Anderson is not your husband and your mariage..."
"I won't have you insult my husband, he'll return soon to me and his child!"
"A European ship has entered the harbor...
I can feel that... it's Olaf!"
"Come, Hanake, let us decorate the house with flowers for the reception!"
After a night of waiting awake in vain...
"I'm going to the consulate to ask for him!"
"O-Take-San's time is up.
She must go back to the Yoshiwara.
The child will be entrusted to the State."
"Master, help!
They want to steal O-Take-San's child!"
"Olaf Anderson, help for godsake!
They are trying to steal your child!"
"...now that she is free again, she must return to the 'Holy Forest'!"
"Go away!
You weren't concerned about Buddha's sacred service.
You just wanted to have your revenge!"
"My gratitude for your protection, Lord.
But I cannot become your wife...
I am the wife of Olaf Anderson!"
"Come, it is at least your duty to help that poor O-Take-San!"
"He is coming, O-Take-San!
He is coming!"
"Why doesn't he come himself...
I know... he has forgotten me...
it was Your will!"
"He can come collect the child himself, tell him that!"
"Go inside and get your child!"
"It's better to die with honour than to live in shame!"
"Where is O-Take-San?"
"O-Take-San is dead!"

This movie was digitally restored by the Swedish Film Institute in 2017.
For the restoration, the following five elements were used:
A black/white nitrate copy with Swedish text, a nitrate color copy with Dutch text, a black/white dupe neg with English text, a black/white IP and a black/white dupe neg with Swedish texts.
The film's original color has been re-created with the Dutch nitrate copy as a reference.
As some original title cards were missing, they were re-created with the help of the Swedish nitrate copy.
During the reign of King Johan III a bitterly cold winter swept over Sweden the like of which had never been seen in living memory.
The King discovered a conspiracy among his Scottish mercenary troops.
The soldiers of fortune were ordered to leave and they were kept under guard until they crossed the border.
Their leaders were bold and fearless men. They were arrested and sent to the tower.
...and the youngest, Sir Archie.
As long as they remained within the bounds of Swedish rule they dare not reveal their identities.
They donned rough hides and claimed to be journeymen tanners roaming the country in search of work.
And by the time they reached the border they were completely famished.
In those days, an impoverished fish hawker lived in Marstrand a man by the name of Torarin.
Most of the time he was on the road selling salted and dried fish.
"I have had great news today, Grim. The sea has frozen over.
Not only the bays and sounds, but quite far out to sea."
"Since we will pass by the vicarage at Solberga, Grim we could stop there and ask if the ice will bear our weight all the way to Marstrand."
Generally, the dog was still and merely blinked at his master's words.
But should he heard something displeasing he climbed on top of the load they carried pointed his nose skywards, and howled.
"Dear dog, what do you have against Solberga?
Have we not many times swung past the vicarage to pay Sir Arne a visit?"
At the vicarage, the estate known as Solberga the vicar, Sir Arne, ate his supper in the company of the members of his household.
The vicar was an old man who retained his dignity and vigor. Sir Arne...
While the years had not been kind to his wife. The Vicar's Wife...
Seated on the other side of Sir Arne was the curate. Curate...
At the far end of the table were Sir Arne's niece, Berghild and her foster sister Elsalill, an orphan taken in by the vicar's household. Elsalill... Berghild...
Torarin was the only person present not belonging to the household and his gaze kept returning to the ironclad chest at the foot of the fourposter bed.
This was where Sir Arne stored a fortune in silver coins and it was said they filled the chest to the very brim.
Though Torarin was a man of little means he had no desire to possess this fortune for he had heard that Sir Arne had taken the money from the large monasteries that once flourished in this country and that the old monks had prophesied
"Why are they sharpening knives over at BranehÃ¶g?"
"Tell me, why are they sharpening such long knives over at BranehÃ¶g on this very night?"
"Do you not hear the scraping and filing?
Do you not hear the hissing and squealing?"
"How can you hear them sharpening knives over at BranehÃ¶g?
That estate is miles away.
Pray let us finish our supper."
ACT II
That very evening a banquet was held at the inn at BranehÃ¶g.
And all the townspeople were invited.
"The old saying holds true:
The closest neighbor is the last to arrive."
"I still see them in my mind's eye sharpening their knives.
God only knows what they plan."
"It was fortunate that the vision lady vicar saw was no more ominous than a few journeymen tanners preparing the tools of their trade."
Long after midnight, a few men left the inn at BranehÃ¶g in order to saddle their horses and return home.
"Come out!
Come out! The vicarage is on fire!"
"Last night Sir Arne and his entire household were murdered by three men entering the house by way of the smokehole in the roof.
Men dressed in rough hides..."
"Sir Arne's horse is gone and so is the sleigh!"
ACT III
The impoverished young maid, the sole survivor of the bloodbath, was taken by Torarin to come live with his mother and himself in their cottage.
Torarin's cottage was situated at the highest point of the island.
And all the Scottish mercenaries, mariners and fishermen locked in by the ice at Marstrand used to pass by his cottage on their way to see if the sea had begun to cast off its blanket of ice."
Many were the times Elsalill regarded those who passed by.
She would ponder on how blessed they were to have something to look forward to.
She yearned for nothing on earth.
"I am not wealthy enough, Elsalill to feed and clothe you only for you to be idle and nurture your grief."
"Oh, Mother Katri! The last to be slain was my foster sister.
She pleaded to be spared but one of the men stabbed her to the heart.
"Had I not hidden behind a wall I would be with my dear foster sister now!"
"I hope they are alive, so I may rip the hearts from their chests!
I hope they are alive, so I may see them drawn and quartered!"
"We did not come to frighten you, good maiden, but to implore you to share your tale with us."
"We came to Marstrand to book passage to Scotland, but all the fjords and sounds are frozen.
Now we while away the hours and would be much obliged if you were to share your tale with us."
"Show the gentleman you do not lack the breeding to respond properly, Elsalill.
You were born to a higher station and are not a lowly fish wench."
After that day, Sir Archie often ventured to Torarin's cottage to speak to Elsalill...
"God himself has sent you to me, Elsalill!"
"Elsalill, will you accompany me to Scotland as my wife?"
"There I will build you a castle of which you will be the distinguished mistress."
"Do you see the hair entwining my hand, Elsalill?
Do you see the lock of fair hair?"
"In this very same manner the hair of my foster sister was twisted around the hand of her killer."
"We frighten ourselves unnecessarily, Elsalill.
Look, it was but a few sunbeams shining in from the window."
"Sir Archie, Sir Archie! Why must you call the dead to mind?"
"Leave me, leave me, Sir Archie.
For now my mind dwells solely on the dead."
"Grim, my dear dog, you can no longer doubt that we travel across the sea.
Look, a large ship is locked in the ice."
"What do you say? Shall we call to the skipper and hear if he wants to buy our fish?"
If the ice never broke up it would be impossible to set sail for Scotland.
Sir Archie wished to discuss this matter with the skipper.
"A man like yourself who travels everywhere and hears everything, do you know why God keeps the gates of the sea barred for so long? Holding us all captive?"
"Once I spent a whole month in Bergen when headwinds were so strong not a single ship could put out..."
"You see, one of the ships stuck in the harbor was carrying a man who had stolen from the church.
And he would have escaped, had it not been for the raging storm..."
"As soon as he was brought ashore the weather turned beautiful and the wind became benign..."
"Do you now know why I asked why God keeps the gates of the sea barred?"
"He requested passage to Scotland for himself and his men but I do not like to have such ruffians aboard my ship..."
ACT IV
Not long afterwards Elsalill had a peculiar dream.
She thought she saw her dead foster sister standing before her...
Elsalill saw that they were in a room where the proprietress of the tavern had her maid stationed to wash dishes and tankards.
Her sister seemed to beckon her to help wash up.
The next day the dream lingered and would not fade...
And she was irresistibly drawn to the places her foster sister had taken her in the dream.
"Rather than simply standing there you might come in and give me a hand with the dishes."
"Drink, my brother!
Sir Arne's fortune is not yet gone."
She could not betray him.
He was dear to her heart.
She could not send him to be drawn and quartered.
She could not bear to see his hands and feet seared off.
"God bless you for coming to see me tonight, Elsalill."
"Elsalill, I have not been to see you for many days since grave thoughts plagued me.
But when I happened upon you just now my heart told me what I must do to be released from my torment forever.
"I weep, Sir Archie for the love I bear in my heart for you is too strong."
"Soon the sea will open and ships will be able to set sail to the country from which I come.
Elsalill, will you go with me?"
"You must go with me, Elsalill or I will be doomed."
"Tonight I will come for you, Elsalill.
I must have your decision tonight."
"Why are you out here weeping?
Why did you not stay in the cellar?"
"I left because I did not wish to hear the words of the evildoers on your premises."
"I happened, however, to hear three men talking and one said:
Drink, my brother.
Sir Arne's fortune is not yet gone."
"If you can witness such words, you do best not to run away.
For you must go with me to the rightful authorities so they may seize the murderers and duly punish them."
ACT V
The skipper sent word to Sir Archie and his men that they may board ship this evening.
The sea had begun to open up to the west.
They might even gain free passage to Scotland before first light.
"Go to the inn and settle things.
I must speak to Elsalill before we leave."
"Sir Reginald and Philip have gone to the inn while Sir Archie has gone to Torarin's cottage."
"Make haste and fly, the town guards are after you!"
"They are looking for the men who murdered Sir Arne."
"Did you recognize me, Elsalill, and set them on me?"
"They are coming for you.
Go!"
"Have you considered that I no longer will have a hope of ever redeeming myself?
"Why did you do it, Sir Archie?"
"We had been driven mad by hunger and by the cold.
We were senseless with drink.
I did not know what I was doing."
"Why do you play me false just when I trusted you most?"
"Do not fear me, Elsalill.
I am again the man I was.
I have command of my senses..."
"And no harm will befall you on this night either, I assure you that."
And using Elsalill as a shield Sir Archie ran for the door.
A wild wolf of the woods she had loved. An evil murderer she shielded with her own body.
And as Sir Arne took another step the pike plunged into Elsalill's heart.
All night long the skipper paced the deck of his ketch...
Who could know what possessed the skipper to be out on a night such as this.
His crew was safely aboard ship and so were the passengers destined for Scotland.
It was not until dawn's early light that the skipper saw the sight he was longing for.
Fjords and sounds were now open far out to sea.
But the inlet where his ship was locked in showed no channels, it was frozen solid.
"I implore you to help me find the maid the Scotsmen brought to your ship last night..."
"Last night she was abducted by the killers of Sir Arne and they brought her to your ship..."
"The town guard will not venture out this far. Not to a ship carrying a hundred soldiers of fortune. They are unwilling to engage them in battle..."
"Now I know why we have been held back while all other ships may put to sea.
It is because we have evildoers on board."
"Stay calm and obey that man.
This is the will of God."
As soon as the criminals were brought to shore the storm began to rage again.
And from his lofty vantage point on deck the skipper saw a lengthy procession approach his ship.
It was the womenfolk of Marstrand, both young and old
They were clad in mourning and young men carried a litter.
They had come to collect the young maiden who had loved an evildoer and had given her life to destroy him.
...and in their wake the tempest tore up the ice over which they had but lately passed.
And by the time they reached Marstrand with Elsalill the gates of the sea stood open.

I have ... ouch.
Sally in Tyrol
So this is Tyrol!
Strange neighborhood.
At the tourist hotel.
Dearest Kitty!
Unfortunately I can not arrive until next week.
You write that you are harrassed by gentlemen, but I know my Kitty, who only thinks about her Harry.
Who is this sweet young lady?
Don't bother, she rebuffs everybody.
Allow me to introduce myself, Sally Meyer!
Which room would you like, sir?
What's your room number?
In this case I would like to have number 14!
If I really want to, I can be very nice!
Dear Harry!
One more admirer, a Mr. Sally Meyer from Schöneberg.
He seems harmless, so I will prefer him to the others, so that they will avoid me.
Thousand kisses, your Kitty.
Act Two
Zounds!
Marvel at this!
Pure nature, everything real and massive!
Dearest wife!
Arrived well. Just marvelled at a gorgeous piece of nature.
Your Sally.
Will you wear your charming suit for dinner as well?
Am I supposed to come naked for dinner?
But if you want me to!
Quite cramped here!
That's what I like.
Why do you keep stepping on my foot?
Should I step on my own foot?
Allow me to introduce myself, Sally Meyer.
Don't they serve any food?
Strange place!
Now serve us for a change.
After dinner.
Well Mr. Sally, how did you like the food?
Not as good as at Aschinger's!
Do you know Watzmann?
Let me think, Watzmann - Watzmann -
Didn't he marry Nanni Lammer?
I'm talking about the mountain Watzmann!
We will climb this mountain tomorrow.
May we ask you for a dance?
No, we are tired  and futhermore we have different plans!
Who is this anyway?
Allow my to introduce myself, Sally Meyer.
Schulze, from Plauen!
You are from Plauen?
Then you can't join the conversation at all.
Sleep well!
Let's see, what we can do!
How high is Watzmann?
2.800 meters.
Dearest wife!
Tomorrow I will climb Watzmann, not to be confused with the company Watzmann  Co. Kisses, Sally.
Sally's nightmare
I knew, that Watzmann is open to reason!
The next morning.
Beautiful weather today.
Pity that it doesn't rain!
Rowdy!
Pleased to meet you, Sally.
Can I speak to you outside?
I have just been outside!
Roast hare ... 2.75 Sally Meyer ... 4.15
Act Three
Tomorrow we will meet for a duel!
I don't mind. If I am late, start without me!
You try to chicken out!
If you were a beautiful young girl ...
Phone call for Mr. Schulze from Plauen!
Here Schulze from Plauen, who is there?
What do you have against this gentleman?
Is this a conversation for you?
Here Schulze from Plauen, who is there?
Well, Mr. Sally, are you ready?
For 25 years.
I thought we will go upwards, but now it's going downwards.
Over there it will go upwards again!
Listen, I don't tolarate such jokes!
How do we get up Watzmann?
First you go crossways, then crooked, then bended, and than you will hit the mountain cabin with your nose.
I'll be damned if I understood a word.
What's the closest way to Watzmann?
Just follow your nose, then you'll be there in no time!
Why are you suddenly so jolly?
Happy is somebody who meets a compatriot!
Hooray, here he is!
I already worried about you!
I wouldn't mind that!
It seems you are finished.
You wouldn't believe what I have climbed before!
If we will fall now, we will fall together.
I would like this very much.
Isn't this a great view?
Our supplies will not last long.
And the air up here!
This is the fine Limburg cheese.
Darling...
We will eat it on our way back!
Take all of me, I'm yours!
You dither so much. Are you afraid to fall?
Harry longs for his Kitty. Act Four
Could you buy a ticket to Tyrol for me?
At Watzmann's summit
So this is Watzmann.
I don't like this gentleman at all.
Your husband's name is Sally Meyer and he is in Tyrol right now?
Dear Harry!
One more admirer, a Mr. Sally Meyer from Schöneberg. He seems harmless, so I will prefer him to the others, so that they will avoid me.
Thousand kisses, your Kitty.
Sally Meyer - and harmless!
You will talk yourself into the abyss!
Then I will talk myself out of it as well!
You should be filmed like this!
I will not make a fool of myself.
Mister Sally buzzes off.
Mister Meyer and Miss Kitty are climbing Watzmann!
He will come down faster than he got up!
Why did you run down so fast?
Don't ask me, ask the mountain.
In the mountain cabin.
I'm afraid we will have to stay overnight!
The two of us in this small cabin?
Mister Meyer, make yourself comfortable!
Just to show you, that I am not shy!
I can't even open those boots!
I used to be a salesman at a shoe store!
Do you snore, adorable beauty?
Then you may stay!
Don't hurry, they will not escape us!
Don't say this, Sally has a good nose.
Mister Meyer, you awoke me.
I will make you sleepy again.
The next morning.
Sally, that's how I have to see you again?
So look the other way!
Did you ever climb Watzmann?
Then you can't join the conversation at all.
You are madly in love with your Sally, aren't you?
Would you hold it against her?
The End
Die Puppe was approved by the Berlin Board of Censors at a length of 1375 metres.
The only known contemporary nitrate copy of the film that has survived, which is in the Filmarchiv Austria in Vienna now, is 1305 metres long.
It's tinted and it contains German titles and inserts.
The basis for the video remastering is the internegative of this copy that's been photochemically restored by the Filmarchiv Austria in 2000.
The worst damage was digitally restored.
Missing intertitles were restored and marked by the FWM logo.
The positioning of an intertitle that previously appeared in the wrong place was rectified.

Your nephew Lancelot!
What do you want from my little nurseling?
!
Lancelot, you should marry!
You get married!
Don't let yourself get talked into anything!
Our little sister's going to get married.
Forty maidens are at the door!
How does one get to the abbey?
Dear brothers!
Money's getting tight - food, tighter - soon we'll have nothing left to nibble!
What are you disturbing our meagre meal for?
Forty maidens are on my trail!
Don't exaggerate, my son!
Protect me from the maidens - and I'll be happy to starve with you!
Refresh yourself, my son!
We like to give - but only a little!

Available for bachelors, widowers and misogynists!

Only if it doesn't hurt!
END OF THE FIRST ACT.
SECOND ACT.
Hilarius has made a doll in the image of his daughter.
Laugh a little, Ossi!
What are you doing tickling my daughter?

What am I supposed to do?
Should I hit her again?
Then I'll take more beatings.
Mother, our second Ossi is finished!
Hilarius, you really are a master!
Is it any wonder, when you've got this sort of apprentice?
!
You have to bring me something new.
Come in, young man!
He's lucky a customer's here!
Dollbaby, you're my shining star.
O, woe is me!
I'm done for.
Fix the arm - in the meantime I'll play the doll!
O, how improper!
I want a proper doll of solid character!
I have one completely irreproachable doll!
Bring the doll into the shop.
Now, my dollbaby, what do you have to say to Mummy?
Just as naughty as Ossi.
So no-one feels neglected.
My favourite meal is chocolate pudding!
When he starts with his stories...
How we lookin' here?
In the meantime get acquainted with the mechanism!
That's what I call a solid character!
Ahhh, women!
It would be like you, to go drinking expensive paints!
Careful - she's freshly lacquered!
Very well, I'll buy dolly here and take her with me straightaway.
There must be a screw loose!

END OF THE SECOND ACT.
THIRD ACT.
Out of grief over his lost nephew,
Baron von Chanterelle sees his end approaching.
To whom did you promise the vase?
You should all divide everything up evenly.
That's on account of your bad planning!
Your nephew Lancelot is here with a young lady!
She's from an old patrician family.
They're all very formal.
Everyone get changed for the wedding!
We're pleased to see you healthy again!
You're able to get undressed on your own?
She must have one complex mechanism.
What is that doll doing here?
- I sold her!
-
Master, hear the confession of a broken man.
This is truly hair-raising.
O, you hyena of lust!
I can't bear the shame - I'm throwing myself out the window.
What use is this horrible life?
!
Wedding at Castle Chanterelle.
My bride doesn't have any appetite.
You're both so quiet?
!
Oh - my bride isn't wound up!
Hippolyt is going to pay you the dowry.
If something goes wrong afterwards - then it's nobody's fault.

Goodbye, Mrs Executive Customs Inspector Secretary!
Good night, Mrs Substratum Appellate Supernumerary!
Sleep well, Kreuzwendedich!
Do you need any more pieces of advice?
Thanks, I've got an instruction manual.
Due to his grief, Hilarius has been sleepwalking.
It's just a doll!
We'll just put her in the junk room.
Turn away, dearest brothers!
And now, my son, let us assist in carrying your heavy burden.
Carry her into the junk room!
Oh, isn't that kind of the brothers!
Yes, they're kind brothers!
If I yell now, he'll fall down from there!
The man's the head of a family!
- He should keep living!
A pity that you're only a dolly!
Sweet Ossi!
Lancelot is dreaming.
I can't believe you're a real girl!
A mouse!
You're afraid of a mouse?
Yeah, you're a girl all right!
I drove them to the abbey.
We're too tired - we're not going anywhere!
Good thing I dropped in when I did!
Ossi, the daughter of the well-known dollmaker Hilarius, and Lancelot, nephew of the Baron Chanterelle, were legally married. - The Registrar, Ungefer
Now I'm free of all worries!
Die Spinnen (The Spiders) was Fritz Lang's third feature film... and the first to establish his reputation as one of Germany's... foremost silent directors.
Lang's work on The Spiders... prevented him from directing the expressionist classic...
The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, a film that had been assigned to him... by producer Erich Pommer.
The credits of The Spiders, however, include several names... famous by Caligari, such as Set Designer Hermann Warm and... actress Lil Dagover.
Filmed in 1919, The Spiders was made... in two parts designed to be shown on two different theatre dates.
Lang's plans to complete the serial story with a third... and fourth part to be titles The Secret of the Sphinx and For Asia's Imperial Crown... were unfortunately never realized.
The film's obsession with diabolical evil directed by... a powerful but unseen force is a foreshadowing... of the Dr. Mabuse films made by Lang three years later...
Part of a series of adventure films in exotic locations... popular in Germany at the time, The Spiders was a... boxoffice success and made Decla the leading German studio.

Lio Sha.
"Where is Kay Hoog, the favorite in tomorrow's race?"
Kay Hoog.
"Kay Hoog lives only for sport.
He's probably forgotten all about tonight's party amid the preparation for tomorrow's race."
"Each of you knows the great importance of a message in a bottle...
It is the last attempt of shipwrecked sailors to send a message."
"Today as I headed toward shore aboard my yacht..."
"I hurried home to open the bottle."
To whomever finds this:
Please notify Harvard University... Cambridge Massachusetts, immediately that I was taken... prisoner here near the 75th longitude by descendants of the Incas... who by tradition still faithfully offer human sacrifice to the sun.
Unbelievable treasures lie buried below the ruins of their temples... which are probably inherited from their old King...
Beneath the so-colled "Holy Sea" extends a gold mine, which appears to be inexhaustible.
Today I escaped my torturers and made it to the coast...
In the name of God, help me.
May 5, 1918.
Fred Johnson.
"I found the point on a map..."
"and wired Harvard University immediately."
"As proof that this mystery really exists. I have the reply."
Professor Johnson has been missing... for six months from Peru expedition.
Harvard University
"Consequently, I will not be in tomorrow's race for the Golden Trophy... of San Francisco.
The golden treasures of the ancient Incas are far more inviting."
Mouton Rothschild, 1863.
"Good luck, Kay Hoog."
"A broken glass means luck."
That night.
The next morning.
"Do not interfere with the Spiders' business."
Dr. Telphas.
"The assembly of Spiders is waiting for you."
"Report on our nighttime visit to Hoog and show the captured document...
Inform the Spiders precisely of my plans.
The golden treasure must be ours."
"At the Master's order, Lio Sha has convened this meeting... to inform you of an important matter."
"The Master wants you to finance this undertaking immediately... so that we can get there ahead of Kay Hoog."
The two expeditions prepare.
"Cuicatlan is the southern-most station of the South Mexican Railway."
"The line was built by the government to establish a connection... to a balloon station where meteorilogical measurements are taken."
"I will lead the expedition myself, and you will accompany me, Dr. Telphas."
On board the scenic car of the South Mexican Railway.
A telegram arrives for Harry Rongoon.
"Paging Mr. Rongoon!
Paging Mr. Rongoon!"
A chance reunion.
"I am employed by the meteorological station in Cuicatlan.
I fly a measurement balloon."
"My next mission is a flight over the Crated Mountains of the Cordillares in Chile."
In the bar of Cuicatlan.
The Spiders recruit.
"Gentlemen!
Twenty dollars per day and a hundred dollars bonus!"
"If you want to go along, you have to be on time.
I leave at exactly 6 o'clock."
"Free the balloon!"
The next day, over the Cordillares.
"This is a document written in peculiar characters that I took from the Spiders... in the bar.
As much as I can make out, it is about a mysterious diamond ship."
The Spiders' expedition.
"It's not enough that we have Kay Hoog opposing us for the gold treasure... Now he also has the key to our biggest secret, the diamond ship."
"Where the sun sets in the west... lies the Holy Sea upon which no man has ever sailed."
"Every morning in the sun's first rays there bathes in the sea... the Priestess of the Sun... a golden woman...
Eldora."

The ruined city of the old Incas.
"If you really want to..."
Naela, Priestess of the Sun, arrives to bathe in the Holy Sea.
Again the great day comes which occurs every fifty-two suns, the Great Festival of the Sun."
"We will make a human sacrifice, so that the race of the Incas... will again become great and renew its ancient splendor."
"Flee from here.
Save yourself.
Death waits for you here."
"Flee, otherwise you are lost!
No white man has ever left this valley alive."
And Kay Hoog saw...
"You will never leave here alive.
"Tell us how you took her prisoner..."
"During the nigt I saw smoke rising.
I investigated and saw..."
"On the day of the Great Festival the blood of the prisoners will stain... the sacrificial rock and you. Priestess of the Sun, will offer the sacrifice."
"I offer flowers which are pure and white, as sacrifice. But the blood... of a man? Kill?
... Me?
Let there be no sacrifice."
"You must sacrifice them to the sun, so our people will be great... and powerful. Again as in time past."
"Flee!
Flee!"
"I will save you, as you saved me."
The gold mine under the Holy Sea.
"The holy candles must not burn.
They bring death."
"No one will find us here. This is the sanctuary of... the Priestess of the Sun, which none may enter."
An underground waterfall.
"Let me go with you... far away from here."
And Lio Sha?
"All exits are guarded...
it is impossible to escape."
"Then there is only one way out!
The waterfall must have an outlet..."
"Since her childhood I have trained Naela for this day.
I know how to force her."
The Sun Festival.
"I will personally come to get you, that we may make the sacrifice to the sun."
"O Mighty Sun!"
"Gold!
Gold!"
The holy candles are burning.
"Gold!
Gold!"
"Come to your senses men!
Everyone will get his share of the treasure!"
The survivors.
And Kay Hoog...

Weeks later... back in San Francisco.
"You still have a secret document of the Spiders.
I am here to get it."
"The Diamond Ship document?
It's in good hands."
"We shouldn't be enemies any longer.
You saved my life. I love you, Kay Hoog."
"There is my heart and my love."
"Beware Kay Hoog.
You have rejected Lio Sha's love...
now fear her fate."
"I'll be back soon, Naela.
It's urget that I go to the city."
And when Kay Hoog returned...
"Where is Naela?"
"Naela!"
The sign of the Spiders.
"Lio Sha... you will pay dearly for this!"

The Ancestress Austrian silent film from 1919
The Viennese Kunstfilm-Industrie presents the charming Liane Hain in:
The Ancestress based on the play by Franz Grillparzer
Tragedy in six acts Cast
Count Zdenko of Borodin
Berta, his Daughter The Ancestress of the House of Borotin
Jaromir
Boleslav, a bandit
Act One
The next morning
My cousin suddenly died last night.
Now I am the last survivor of our house, which will perish after me.
Act Two
The last days of my existence shall be devoted to your happiness.
Choose your husband freely from all sons of this country.
This summer night, as I went farther than ever before, I was ambushed in the forest.
By chance I found him again.
Soon, it will not be chance anymore.
Noble be his dynasty, noble his deed Bring him to me, I want to meet him.
Away from me!
Away!
Away!
Do you want to kill your father?
What was that?
Was this a dream?
Berta!
Berta!
Tell me, what's the matter, girl, that you frighten a life weary sleeper as if you were a nocturnal ghost?
I just came from the balcony When you fell asleep I went out longingly to wait for my dearest!
Woe is me, the ancestress!
The ancestress of this house.
Named Berta just like you.
Beautiful and charming, just like you, forced by her parents into a hated marriage
In her lover's arms, she was killed by her husband, who stabbed her into the heart.
She has to wander restlessly until this house has perished.
Whenever doom is imminent, she appears.
And you can hear her lament.
Lamenting her powerlessness, as she can foresee but not prevent.
Act Three
I come from the woods, where I was ambushed by bandits.
I shall inform the count.
Whatever this house can offer, it shall be at your service.
It's him who saved me.
He is the noble man.
Tell me your rank and name.
My noble guest, go to sleep, may an angel guard you.
Did all hell break loose?
Listen, those words, she prays.
Prays for me!
There you are, beloved.
Don't send me away so coldly.
Berta, my Berta.
Here and there, there and here.
It's her everywhere and nowhere!
Feel me, feel me, it's me.
And at the light of dawn a face appeared with well known features, yes, your face.
Are you already considered family?
Escape my son, while there still is time.
Whatever may happen, I will be on your side.
If necessary I will perish with you.
Act Four
Forgive my intrusion.
Suspicious folk was sighted near your castle.
Members of the gang of bandits, the scourge of this neighborhood.
My son in law, who was ambushed this night as well.
Many have been hanged already and I will get the rest too.
Do you want to tarnish the soul of this fair maiden with your hate?
You are strong, help us to fight them.
Take this sword.
Never.
Don't count on me.
I'm not much good as a bloodhound.
The incident last night has shattered his constitution.
He barely is himself anymore.
Stop, captain.
I know my duty as well you know yours.
I will fight on your side!
My sword will prove that Count Borotin is no accomplice to the bandits.
What was that?
Where were you?
And how did you get wounded?
To proceed seemed dangerous, so I returned.
I heared the shot from my chamber.
As I knew your father was outside,
I wanted to help, ran down and was shot.
We almost caught the leader of the bandits.
I shot him in the arm, we fought, and he escaped, but he left this piece of cloth.
Act Five
Bandit!
Yes, I am the one they are searching for.
I am the cursed bandid Jaromir.
My Berta, don't be sterner than God.
Don't reject me, you lovely.
If you don't escape with me, I shall stay.
Here they shall bind me, chain me, then you will see my bones rot.
Escape with me.
At 12 o'clock I will wait at the crypt.
But one more thing, child - get me weapons.
Don't be afraid.
Your vow gave my life new meaning.
It wouldn't take weapons to take me to freedom.
This bottle would be enough.
If it puts your mind at rest, take it.
Isn't this a dagger?
Don't take it, it's cursed.
Farewell my child, the future is bright and don't forget midnight.
This underground corridor leads to the dungeons of my castle.
They brought one of the bandits, sir.
He wants to talk to you.
He says, it is important for him and for you.
20 years ago I passed the castle, when I saw a handsome boy at the lake.
I made him follow me into the dark forest.
Act Six
The others wanted to kill him, but I took pity on him.
So your son became mine.
He forgot you and honored me as his father.
And I thought he had drowned, because his hat floated on the lake.
God, my son is alive.
Bring him to me, even though he is a bandid, I thank you.
He is here, he is the stranger that found shelter here.
Jaromir, my brother!
Tumble, you pillars of earth, the son has killed his father.
I am not your son?
Look at this ground, you walk on your ancestors' heritage, you are a Count Borodin.
Light at the chapel?
I want to see, see, see, even if I should perish.
All sins will be forgiven, but not patricide.
Berta, Berta, escape with me.
I am not your Berta.
Illusion from hell, You are not my Berta.
Everything in vain, I will not let you.
This is Berta's face and there is my place!
Part in peace, you peaceless.
The end
In the film, Robert Reinert wanted to describe the atmosphere that prevailed in 1919 as a "nervous explosive"
caused by war and misery.
The film was modified several times by the censors.
The copy distributed at first in 1919 was 2637 meters long.
In November 1920, the Office of Censorship in Berlin had a copy that was 2054 meters long.
Gosfilmofond in Moscow has a black and white copy 1646 meters long, and the Bundesarchiv-Filmarchiv has a colorized fragment 65 meters long.
Approximately 777 meters of a U.S. version, whose colors are deteriorating and have a solarized effect, are kept at the Library of Congress.
A third version of has been lost.
Our reconstruction efforts have tried to be faithful to the original concept of the film.
Therefore some shots and sequences were swapped and new headings added.
Colorization reconstruction meets models and conventions of the time.
Only a few of the "animated intertitles"
spoken about by all the critics of the time were found in the U.S. fragment and near a German outtake.
You, messengers of the most intense pleasure and suffering the deepest!
When you come to fail, Man is reduced to a beast,
Nerves are you not the essence of the soul?

"Hey, Marja, your wedding dress."
"Happy child, tomorrow you'll be married!"
"Don't you feel the air is filled with a mysterious power?"
"Don't you feel the Earth vibrate with an unspeakable force?"
"I have to go and see for myself."
"Oh, if only the marriage would not take place."
"Do you know what it means to marry someone you do not love?"
"I want to belong to a man who has a soul:
A man like Professor Johannes!"
The assistant gardener
"What's going on?"
The street rises.

"Am I a coward?"
"No, I am not a coward!"
"Why?"
"I do not know."
"Shoot him!"
"We have also lost our second son!"
"How 	could this happen?"
"I didn't know this would happen!"
"Blood flows on my wedding day!"
End of Act One.
Act Two
Marja's wedding day
Richard: "Did the assistant gardener finally hand her my bouquet?"
Marja: "This is not a murderer. Give him a religious burial."
Richard: "He does not deserve it."
The blind sister of Professor Johannes.
"Your little sister is looking for you, Professor Johannes!"
"Mother, why you are no longer alive?
You could advise me?"
Matthew 5.28: "And I tell you:
Whoever looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her, in his heart.
"My brother, I cannot see you, but I feel how much you suffer."
The wedding guests
"Professor Johannes - I'm getting married today."
"IthinkI'llbevery unhappy..."
"Do you remember when you were my teacher?"
"You gave me this animal When there are workers who die of hunger."
"I was happy at the time.
Today I am in despair."
"Marja, go!
Please."
"Marja has disappeared."
"I will never marry Count Richard Colonna."
"My God, what has happened to you?"
"Richard, I cannot be your wife."
"No man of honor can take me as a wife."
"Anotherwouldhavetotake meby force ..."
"Professor Johannes!"
"We'll talk!"
"My sister did not get married."
"I'll explain later."
Roloff urged Marja to tell him what happened.
"Marja, overcome your shame.
Tell me ..."
"I lost consciousness in his arms ..."
Roloff is sure her nerves are raw, having seen the scene with his own eyes.
The love I bear for him is unclean and full of sin.
"This professor must be destroyed!"
How can love, the most beautiful of feelings, be so powerful?
"Mr. Prosecutor, this dramatic incident has the advantage of destroying our most dangerous political opponent!"
The faithful dog
"This is not true!"
"This cannot be true!"
"I swear to God, I saw it with my own eyes."
End of Act Two
Act Three
"Johannes?"
The people
"My faithful dog, tell me where to find our Johannes?"
Night
"Marja, for the love of Christ, tell me the truth!"
"ProfessorJohannespossessedme. "
Popular rally
An argument broke out.
He: "Let us not be misled by ruthless fanatics!"
Intuitively, the blind girl feels there was a relationship between the Bible and her brother.
"Who are you?"
"I'm closer to you than you think ..."
"On the day of trial I will prove his innocence."
Thedayof thetrial
"You will apologize for being ill.
The shame of your presence at court would be a disgrace to the family."
No longer find peace
"He was sentenced to six years in prison!"
"I feel as if I have attended the execution of an innocent person!"
"An unbearable tension reigned in the courtroom."
"He refused to pronounce any word in his defense."
"Given the terrible accusations, he remained silent."
"Then his blind sister came forward."
"My brother is a good man.
He reads the Bible every day."
Whoever looks at a woman in lust has already committed adultery with her, in his heart.
"Thischildwhothoughtshewassaving herbrother unintentionallycondemnedhim."
The love I bear him is unclean and full of sin.
"I assume you're referring to Marja Roloff!"
"You confess then to an illicit love for Marja Roloff from long ago?"
"Your silence will be fatal!"
"Then I swore."
"I swore I saw the scene with my own eyes."
"The verdict pronounced, Johannes broke his silence."
"I am wrongfully convicted, but I'll do my penance."
End of Act Three
Act Four
"Professor Johannes was sentenced to six years in prison!"
"Didn't you see him stare at me?"
"It's unbearable!"
"Why did he say anything?"
"Why was he convicted?"
"Herapedyou."
"Johannes would never do such a thing."
"But I saw it with my own eyes."
"My poor brother.
You saw nothing."
"Yes, I did see.
I even testified."
"My poor brother.
It is impossible for you to have seen anything."
"Tell me the truth?"
Johannespossessedmy soul.
Hedidnotphysicallypossess me."
"I saw it and I testifed to it.
And now she says ...
What does this mean?
Am I a fool or a criminal?"
"What's going on there?"
"We aren't saying anything.
Marja must be silent since I have testified so!"
"But you cannot let an innocent man suffer!"
"I committed perjury.
I am a notorious liar."
Alone!
"I went to the prosecutor.
You must do what your honor requires."
"Another inquest will shed full light on this matter."
Marja leaves the house, resolved to fight for the Johannes's ideas.
"What's going on there?"
"Where am I?"
"Is this my house?"
"Help, help!"
"Help me.
I'm afraid of going insane!"
Wishing to have a clear conscience, Roloff consults a well-known psychiatrist.
"I have a friend who suffers strange hallucinations.
"The worst thing is that he blames himself."
"He gives the impression of being very healthy."
"Here, everyone seems in good health, but all are seriously ill."
"What is the cause of their illness?"
"The progress of civilization, the struggle for survival, fear and the horrors of war, the sins of the parents ..."
"What do you want?
What do you have against me?"
"Why are you crying?"
"You make us feel pity!"
"Nonsense!
You cry for your idol Johannes, whom I arrested."
Our marriage, my dear son, was not happy.

"The doctor speaks of a hereditary disease."
The prosecutor has Johannes freed.
Paranoia
"You have killed me, Roloff!"
"My God, I think that is Elizabeth, my wife."
"If she is dead, it is your fault."
"Nobody ever died as he did."
"Nobody ever went to heaven as he did."
"I am not a murderer.
He committed suicide."
"Is he dead then?"
"His body is visible?"
"He was here, right here."
"Do not cry, I cannot stand it when you cry."
"Am I sick at this point?"
End of Act Four
Act Five
"Nobody knows why I remained silent."
"I wanted to atone for my sins."
"Forgive me, Johannes!"
"My responsibility for what happened to you is heavier than yours."
Richard seeks Marja, his fiancee, and eventually finds her.
Richard: "Marja, just turn the page and move on.
Like you, I left everything.
Henceforth, I will also defend your noble ideas."
"My nerves are frayed, just like those of the world."
"Nerves are the disease of the world!"

"Why go on living now?"
"Now I know why he was silent."
A few days later
Roloff's condition worsens.
"What unhappiness I brought."
"Why are you laughing, you whore?"
"Go as quickly as possible.
I want escape the images that haunt me."
"I choked!
Now death awaits me, too."

Johannes: "You pervert my ideas with violence."
Richard: "Those who oppose the happiness of the people are our enemies."
"I would like to remain with you.
Will you have me under your roof?"
This unclouded happiness   ends in a strange and unexpected manner.
Roloff's newspaper
I understand now.
His love for Elizabeth stops him.
Why remain living?
I, the unlucky one, will sacrifice for their happiness.
"He knew.
That is why he chose death."
"... and I killed him ..."
"She never will learn of it!"
"He no longer loves me.
He loves only you.
I cannot come between you two."
"I'll explain everything to you.
He is haunted by a terrible secret."

"Iprayon my kneesuntilImeetthee,O Lord. "
Elizabeth asked for advice from Marja.
Marja: "Only a magnanimous act will let you reclaim his heart."
In her extreme confusion, Marja chose a terrible act.
"My poor sister is sure to perish in the flames!"
Elizabeth dared not confess her act.
She disappears without a trace.
Richard dies in a street fight.
Richard: "I must make a confession.
For love of you, Marja, I defended ideas which I have never believed in."
Marja:
"Everything is a lie in this world?
Even the ideals?
Why go on living?"
I set fire to the castle causing the death of your sister.
I entered the convent to do penance there.
Marja committed suicide.
Johannes was called to the side of the dying.
"Forgive me again, Johannes.
I pay with my life for that I made you undergo.
I never stopped loving you."
"I think of the ideals that I have defended and for what I'm dying!"

Technical Direction:
Kurt Waschneck.
Cinematography:
Theodor Sparkuhl.
Mister Quaker, the Oyster King of America: Victor Janson
Ossi, his daughter: Ossi Oswalda
Prince Nucki: Harry Liedtke
Josef, Nucki's friend: Julius Falkenstein
Seligson, matchmaker:
Max Kronert The bandleader: Kurt Bois FIRST ACT.
Quaker dictates his mail.
The good Madam Daughter has gone stark raving mad.
Why exactly are you throwing all these newspapers at my head?
Well, the vases have already all been broken.
It's come to our attention that the daughter of the shoe-polish king, Mr Blakpott, has married a count.
That doesn't impress me at all.
I'll buy you a prince.
I'm so happy I could smash the whole house to pieces.
Seligson the matchmaker.
But he's cross-eyed.
For that price they've all got a little flaw.
Dearest Sir!
As the daughter of the shoe-polish king has married a count, and as we all know that shoe-polish doesn't trump oysters, I request that you send me a son-in-law with a pedigree in accordance with my oysters.
Sincerely, Quaker
Prince Nucki;
Residence: 21st Rue, 47th Floor;
Age: 26 years old;
Appearance: tip-top;
Assets: heavily in debt;
Spec.
Attributes: not inclined to marriage.
Ossi is instructed in the ways of marriage.
You shouldn't hold a child like that!
Well, children really shouldn't be coddled.
Now you've got to apply some powder.
Not on the face?
It all goes on the other end.
Well that's pretty odd.
We haven't got to that point yet.
Someone's ringing.
I'm sure someone was outside pressing the button.
I'll check to see if we're home.
I'd like to speak with Prince Nucki about a matter of the heart.
I'll check to see if His Highness will receive you.
In the meantime have a seat on the banister.
His Highness bids you to come in.
Don't fall over
Your Highness, I have a proposal for you - a charming young girl. -
This tall!
...and does she have hair - black as night. -
I go for blondes.
Then she'll just dye it;
with that kind of money it makes no difference.
Your Little Highness!
My adjutant will look her over first.
Put on my suit, so you look presentable.
It's now been 1-1/2 hours, and I still haven't got a husband.
If I don't have a husband within 5 minutes, I'll demolish the entire house!
Be my guest!
That doesn't impress me at all.
END OF THE FIRST ACT.
SECOND ACT.
Josef presents himself to Quaker.
Might I have your card?
PRINCE NUCKI
Take this one for the time being.
PRINCE NUCKI
What do you have to say about that, Daddy - that the prince is here?
He's to wait in the parlour.
If you come to an agreement, wake me.
These folks know how to live!
Josef grows impatient.
Where is the good madam?
In the bath!
- And the good gentleman?
Asleep!
Well, what am I supposed to do with myself here?
Wait!
His Highness the Prince is growing impatient.
That doesn't impress me at all.
The good madam in person.
In with her.
Smells good.
Good Lord he looks dumb.
Oh well, he is a prince after all.
So you want to marry me?
Is that what you want or isn't it? !
Of course that's what I want - just don't throw anything.
Don't you want to introduce me to your father first?
Since it's such a trifle, we don't want to wake him up.
On the way to the ceremony.
We'd like to get married quick.
Prince Nucki, do you take Ms Quaker to be your wife?
You don't even have to ask - he's got nothing to say on the matter.
But didn't I get to sit up front earlier?
Yes, but we weren't married yet then.
Tell the servants that I am your husband.
They wouldn't buy it.
I hereby introduce you to my husband.
Well, you see how pleased they are.
Go into my father's bedroom and introduce yourself.
What's the nearest route to Mr Quaker's bedroom?
I'll provide you with a blueprint of the manor.
Bon voyage.
Come blow my nose.
Well now, who might you be?
Why this is my husband.
...and here you are blowing my nose?
Oh, it stays in the family.
END OF THE SECOND ACT.
THIRD ACT.
On account of the rush, the wedding celebration includes only the closest family members.
Excuse me for introducing you to my son-in-law.
Don't be such a pig!
Say a few words.
It's been a long time since I've had such a good meal.
In the course of the celebration, a foxtrot epidemic suddenly breaks out.
Not so exuberant - think about your family tree.
Oh, bollocks!
Do you foxtrot?
What will your husband the prince have to say about this?
I could do with a wedding like this every day.
Every day pickled herring, - that's bitter.
Nucki is called upon by his friends to go for a stroll.
Would you perhaps be able to lend me a little something?
The wedding nears its end.
I'm sweating like an ape.
Everyone sweats as he's able.
Whereabouts is your husband?
I'm so very happy-
Why did you get married then?
Shame on you!
- Why you're...
I'm so very happy!
What can be done, will be done.
Here are my rooms, there are your rooms.
Ohhhhh
Go on and call me your sweetie...
Please remove this gentleman.
What a shame, and I was just in the mood.
I'm so very happy-
END OF THE THIRD ACT.
FOURTH ACT.
Nucki comes back from his stroll.
My child, you look pale.
The Association of Millionaires' Daughters for the Prevention of Dipsomania holds an official breakfast for young ladies.
...and so I say, in closing:
"Down with dipsomania!"
If consulting hours aren't held soon, the patients will sober up on their own.
The association's patients.
A shame about the lovely schnapps.
Hold onto me tightly, my ladies.
Everyone out.
I'll cure him.
No!
All right then - we'll settle the matter with a boxing match.
Let go of me, my ladies!
Fight, fight.
So now it's your turn.
Bring the gentleman to my car;
I'm taking him on a private session.
Careful!
Put the gentleman in my husband's bedroom.
The good master is still asleep.
Then take him into my bedroom.
Mousey.
Little Mousey.
Shut it!
Well if that doesn't just take the biscuit!
I'm telling the old man about this.
These aren't my trousers.
Do you have any idea where you are?
With you!
Well, do you know who I am?
A sweet little snail.
Do you know that you're a delightful kisser?
Well, I never!
Please.
A pity that you're married.
I have to get married too.
Do you know that you're both married to one another?
I got married in your name.
The real wedding.
NOW, THAT IMPRESSES ME.
This man has been brought to me as one who misleads the people.
He is accused of sedition and blasphemy, for which he should suffer death.
My Lord Governor!
My Lord Governor there is a custom in Jerusalem, that at this season of the feast one condemned man should be released.
I remember the custom.
Who shall it be?
This man who many of you call their king?
Or shall it be Barabbas?
Release Barabbas!
-Release Jesus of Nazareth!
-No, not Barabbas!
-Barabbas!
-Release Barabbas!
Crucify the Nazarene!
They"re mad, Lord Governor. Barabbas is a rebel.
A robber, an assassin.
Release Barabbas!
Take the Nazarene, scourge him and bring him here again and he shall be crucified.
All right, that"s enough.
Take him out.
Open up.
Come on.
One man to be set free.
Set free?
You ought to know the custom of the season.
The Governor offered them either the prophet or you.
He listened to the voices and they chose you.
I make no comment. Come on.
Get on the move.
All right.
Give us a hair of your beard.
It ought to be lucky, considering how things have gone for you.
I"m not used to the light. lt plays tricks.
If I was you, I shouldn"t loiter.
I"d want to see the back of this place before they change their minds.
Get on your way, will you?
-Who do you think you"re shoving?
-Get going.
All right. I"m going.
Move on.
-There he is.
Release the Nazarene!
-Get out of the way.
What are you standing for, like an idiot?
What are you all hanging around for?
Here"s a fine sight.
Six weeks and nobody"s moved.
What"s happened then?
How did you get out?
This is a surprise, let me tell you.
is that my duck? It"s him!
-Sara!
-There"s the black knave himself...
Cheating his death again, like a good boy.
The clever one.
How did you do it?
I was released to celebrate the holiday as a surprise for you.
Here"s a day to celebrate in all my god.
Come on and tell us the whole story.
You"ve not heard?
I"m the choice of the people.
""Give us Barabbas,"" they said.
Give me some food.
Food for Barabbas. Food for a hungry man.
How does it feel?
How did you feel when they told you?
The choice of the people, eh?
Old Sara here dropping tears so fast all the slopping wine got watered.
-Where did you get your luck?
-What witch gave you that?
Pass him across to me!
-Touch him for luck. That"s it.
-l"m not taking chances.
Get away.
Where"s Rachel?
Shut away mourning for me?
Fetch her down here.
She"s no good for you or anyone else.
-She"s completely changed, I"m telling you.
-What"s wrong with her?
Bring her down.
She"s no good to my old rascal now.
She thinks of nothing, day or night except this prophet from Nazareth, who"s on trial for blasphemy.
Ever since she heard him preach, she has gone off her life like a sick child goes off its food.
Come on, you old empty belly.
There"s no food inside you worth vomiting.
Sit down and eat.
Barabbas, that girl"s no good for you.
Take my word for it. As morbid as a crow in a chimney.
Bewitched by a prophet.
A waste of a handsome girl.
And she"s gone to his trial looking like a widow already.
She knows what happened to her prophet.
That"s the end of him.
-Condemned, was he?
-That"s just it.
They had the choice between him and me, and they chose me.
How do you like that?
The idol of the city.
Tell you what. You"re as good as a king, Barabbas.
They call the prophet King of the Jews, but they chose you.
Show your respects to King Barabbas.
-Let"s have a crowning of him.
-Yes!
-The wicked old King of Judea.
-What are you doing?
-Come on, give him his robes.
-You be nice to your King Barabbas.
More wives than Solomon and his subjects as ripe as old pumpkins.
Here"s your scepter. Take it.
Set him on his throne.
-What"s that?
-That"s the scepter.
Sit down on your throne.
Kneel down, all you miserable scum of the earth, and acknowledge.
Kneel down, you scum of the earth.
Hail! Hail!
I"ll make laws for you that will tax your constitutions.
I crown you, King Barabbas.
What are you treating me like a clown for?
Here she is, Barabbas, if you want her.
Look here, Rachel, look who"s been asking for you.
The old rascal back from the dead.
So, here she is.
What"s the matter with me?
Why don"t you look at me?
Barabbas, let me go.
Not until you"ve told me you"re glad I"m alive.
-l wouldn"t wish any man his death.
-What do you mean by that?
Don"t make me speak to you.
-What do you mean by that?
-Don"t make me speak to you.
That"s a warm welcome.
I couldn"t follow any further.
I daren"t say what is still to come, but God forgive us all if he can.
What did I tell you?
She"s no good to you now, Barabbas.
Come on.
I"m not here to be made a fool of.
What"s the matter?
Remember how it used to be.
Barabbas, don"t you see what"s happening?
Don"t you understand what set you free?
I just got out of prison.
I need to get the cramp out of my bones.
That"s what"s happened.
-l"m not the same. Nothing is the same.
-You"d better try and make it the same.
Barabbas, listen to me.
For pity"s sake believe me.
He came from God, the man who"s taking your place.
You think I should have been killed instead of him?
You think I ought to be dead?
Barabbas, hear what I say.
He came from God.
That"s none of my worry.
God can look after his own.
-And you can look after me.
-No!
That girl up there was always coming back with strange ideas.
She"s got her head full of them.
Well, it seems she"s got something to think about now, anyway.
-l don"t like the look of it.
-Look of what?
What"s the matter?
The sky.
The light"s gone out of it.
I"ve never known it dark like this in the middle of the day.
Get a light, for mercy"s sake.
Something"s wrong with my eyes.
I can"t see.
Something"s wrong.
Everything"s black.
Black as death.
I knew there was something wrong when I saw that light.
Tell me. Am I going blind?
Am I going blind?
What"s happening?
You know what has happened.
Even the light has left us, now that we"ve killed him.
Well, are you satisfied now?
He"s dead.
Just the same as any other man.
-We"ve seen it.
That"s the end of it.
-He promised to come back.
We shall see that, too.
Only two days and he"ll be in the world again.
Look at his friends.
You think they believe it?
I tell you, you"re mad.
That"s the end of it.
Not tomorrow, but the morning after.
How many days have I been here?
How many days have I been here?
Can"t you hear me?
What"s the matter with you?
What"s the matter?
Two days.
Two days.
Then today"s the third day?
Two and one make three.
What"s so odd?
We"ll see, then.
This is the morning of the third day.
Barabbas, where are you going?
Now you know it"s true.
All I know is the tomb is empty.
-Who moved the stone?
-God moved it.
God himself?
You saw him do it?
A power came from the sky.
It was when the sun was rising, at the beginning of the day.
-First there was the music of a horn.
-Horn?
Then in the air there was an angel.
The whole sky seemed to dismantle.
It was white, it was fire.
It was white fire.
He stretched out his arm. It seemed as long as a spear.
The point of the spear went between the stone and the rock and the stone rolled away.
If only you had been here sooner and seen what I saw.
My eyes are good.
They see nothing but real things.
You have to believe this, Barabbas.
The Master was a man of truth, and he said this would be so.
Did you see a prophet come out of the tomb?
My eyes were so dazzled.
I think I must have covered them.
But when I could see again a man and a woman were together in the garden.
And then she went quickly away.
And the man was the same man they buried in there?
He was like a shadow.
The morning light was behind him.
But I"m sure it was he.
Shadows, light, that"s about the truth of it.
Here"s the truth of it:
Why do you think he should lie about himself when it meant he would be killed?
How do you know what he said?
The priests ought to know more than you do. And they call it blasphemy.
He said:
""Love one another.""
""Love one another""?
And they crucified him for that?
Where are you going?
There are those who can tell you more.
There"s a house in the street of the potters where they meet.
You may find them there.
Go and ask them.
It"s a trick they"re playing.
They took the body and hid it to go on with their story.
Or are you afraid?
Are you afraid of knowing what has happened?
Are you looking for someone?
You like to see it?
The clay making itself?
Some other day.
What"s happened? I heard there was news.
The tomb"s empty, the women said they saw him.
Creed can have strange visions. Only it"s true.
Where"s Peter?
Who could it be?
Don"t open it.
We should get out of this city.
Wiser to go down to Galilee.
Can we hide from the future forever?
Let"s see what is here.
What if they mean to destroy us all?
Leaving no one to tell the knowledge of the man.
Can the word turn to silence?
I"m not afraid of that.
Where is he?
-What have you done with him?
-What do you want with us?
-The truth.
What happened?
-What right have you to be here?
You know what I mean.
What are you all afraid of?
What are we afraid of?
You want to know what we want to know.
-What is the truth of this morning?
-l know the truth.
You stole the body.
You think we might have hidden it here among us.
But something else has happened.
If you find him here, it will only be if he comes himself.
Through that gate, as you did just now.
Don"t you believe it. I saw the body.
He was a dead man.
If you were sure of that, you wouldn"t be here.
He"s risen.
I trust in him and wait.
You"re all mad.
What do you think you"re doing, making that net?
There"s no sea to fish in closer than Galilee.
It"s what I"m used to doing, my hands go to it.
But the streets in the cities have to be the sea for me now.
He made a joke about it when he took us away from the boats.
He said that in the future our fish would be men.
It was a serious joke. It meant he"d given us the word to draw men out of the dark sea into the light.
And you call yourself a fisherman?
Do I have to tell you what happens to the fish?
They struggle about, gasp and die.
We struggle and gasp.
You said something good.
Poor fish.
I, too must struggle and gasp.
And die.
And die in order to live.
That"s where men have the advantage over fish.
They can die to the world, die to the dark sea and begin to live again in the light.
That"s what he promised, and what he promised has happened.
But what has happened we still don"t know.
He"s come back to life.
-He"ll lead us to the new kingdom.
-l"ll believe it when he"s before us.
When I can touch him and hear him.
You"re always full of doubts without any cause.
No cause to doubt that a dead man can come back to life?
No cause.
I can take you now to talk with a man who was dead.
The Master brought him back to life.
Thomas knows him well.
Come, talk to him.
Let him tell you.
You needn"t be afraid.
Lazarus? Will you come to us?
Here"s someone wants to question you.
Come in.
I"ll leave you with him.
You can ask him whatever you like.
They told me death is not.... ls not death.
They brought me here to see because you could make me believe it.
Because you were dead, and were raised from the dead by the man.
I mean the Master.
That is true.
I was dead.
And I know that he is Christ the Son of God who has power over life and death.
What"s it like there?
You were there.
-Tell me what it"s like.
-Like?
-Like? -Yes, what is it this thing you experienced?
What is it?
I have experienced nothing.
Only death.
And death is nothing.
Nothing?
No.
What should it be?
You want me to tell you about the realm of the dead?
I cannot.
How would you tell an unborn child what life is?
It exists.
But it isn"t anything.
To those who"ve been there nothing else is anything either.
No one has asked me this before.
They have listened how life came back to me and gone away praising.
Only you have asked about death.
And none the wiser.
We"re two men who might be dead.
Sharing his body.
Life.
Love one another.
Listen, everybody!
That"s the word.
Love one another!
We can tell them about loving one another.
-Leave me alone. I want to sit.
-What do you want to do, sit and think?
It"s no good thinking.
Come on, let"s go and find a new life.
-Where are you going, Barabbas?
-To see what ""brought back to life"" means.
Love one another!
-Come on.
-My shoe.
Look.
-Hey! Get up!
Come on!
-Leave it alone.
Stay alive.
It"s all you have to do.
It"s not my fault they let him get killed.
You can"t hang it around my neck.
I"ve as much right to be alive as any of you.
You stinking fish.
You"re afraid to look at me because I"m alive.
You, look at me. Look at me!
It may be today that the new world comes.
Today or tomorrow.
But it will come, you will see.
Every day you have promised us, it has never come.
-lt will never come.
-lt will come. I know it.
Please, Rachel, tell us again what it will be like.
You"d better mind what you say.
Don"t you know what can happen to you if they hear you?
Anybody now caught spreading such stories the Son of God, the Messiah and such, is to be judged an enemy of the State and stoned until he"s dead.
It will be as though the Earth has become like a star burned clean.
Everything evil swept away.
We shall look up and there will be angels coming down from the sky and they will put food in front of us and perhaps new clothes to wear.
White, like their own.
Or some blue, like the color of the sky.
Pain and sorrow will sink into the ground, and everything will be made new because the Son of God has risen from the dead.
The world has become his kingdom.
There"s no truth in any of it.
I know this woman.
She doesn"t know the difference between what is real and what she dreamed in her sleep.
Don"t you listen to her.
She"s raking up trouble.
Nothing but trouble.
Trouble for you if you won"t turn and listen to the sounds that have come.
He knows but is afraid to believe it.
Look at you, Barabbas.
How can you see or hear what"s to come?
It will happen, whether you take part in it or not.
He"s right. lt"s dangerous talk.
They"ll pull down our homes, drive us out.
Better listen to this man.
-Let"s hear what the prophet said.
-Don"t leave.
Where are you going?
To where the lepers are, to tell them to be ready for the freedom that"s coming.
-She"s going among the lepers!
-Stop her!
She"s going to set the lepers free.
-Don"t let her go among the lepers!
-Don"t let her set the lepers free!
You have no right to go among the lepers!
Look out, it"s a temple guard!
We don"t want the lepers to be free!
A charge has been lodged against this woman.
-She must be questioned.
-We heard she preaches blasphemy.
Bring her to the temple and we will judge her.
-Take your dirty hands off her.
-Don"t take her! She"s done no wrong.
Don"t take her away.
Rachel!
For blasphemy, and spreading blasphemy, this woman is condemned.
For stirring up evil matters among the people for misleading their minds and denying the wisdom of authority.
For her sins, she has been condemned to death by stoning.
Let the man who accused her and was found just in his accusation cast the first stone.
What must I do?
Take this stone.
Come on.
Throw it at her.
Why should I throw?
-l"ve nothing against her.
-You accused her.
-The law gives you the first stone.
-lt was you.
Or you"ll find yourself there beside her.
Throw quickly. lf you wait, I may be afraid.
You don"t have to think of Barabbas any more.
He"s not coming back.
And if he did, we"d know what to do with him.
You"re still afraid of him because he used to roar at you like a brass bull.
You can"t stand up to him even when he"s gone.
He"s gone to the devil once and for all, I can tell you.
He"s lost his nerve.
He"s creeping about the city like a shivering priest.
Why do you think he"s not come back?
Because he"s afraid to stir hand or foot.
-We don"t know yet, he won"t come back.
-Who cares if he does?
We got a man here who can hang him in his own guts.
He came out of that prison mad.
Acquitted but mad.
We"ll soon see it then.
So, you remembered the way to get here.
Given you up this past week.
You"ll find things altered.
What"s over is over.
I remembered the way.
Bring them across.
God"s curse on you!
The money is sacred! It belongs to the temple!
-The god of battle will destroy you!
-Blasphemy!
You hypocrites. I"ll kill you both.
What are you doing?
Here"s all the treasure we wanted. Come away!
I"ll kill you the way you had her killed.
It seemed to me at the time, Barabbas, when you were given your liberty before it wasn"t a fortunate exchange.
They were calling for death and disorder when they called your name.
This is what I thought and this is what has occurred.
They put the scourge back into the fist.
By that I mean you and your life.
And many men have suffered and died in consequence.
The other man, too.
They"re dying because of that.
This is a local matter, which I hope will soon be adjusted.
The shock and fear of an unreasoning fanaticism will pass.
But the appetite to destroy which, alas, the human being shares with the wild beast, is always with us.
And it has rigorously to be disciplined in the name of civilization...
-...and according to the law.
-That"s what you say.
But I tell you, whichever side of the law we"re on, we"re the same men.
You and your kind, and me and my kind.
How else have you lived except my way?
What we haven"t got, we go out and take.
Let him speak.
How else have you lived except my way?
Whoever"s against us or gets in our way, we get rid of.
My knife may have bitten a few throats, but what about your weapons?
They"ve split thousands upon thousands.
If I"ve taken a passing woman to myself your armies have looted and raped across continents.
And have been called the glory of the earth for doing it.
You were born according to the law and raised according to the law.
I was born by a girl thrown out of a brothel who gave birth and cursed me before she died.
But I tell you, we belong to the same herd.
Unfortunately for you, Barabbas, the law is indispensable.
The law is the pass and permit to life in this world.
You were without it.
However, the law here tells me that a man released by the will of the people at a holy festival cannot thereafter be given a capital punishment.
You can"t kill me?
Easier on you if we could.
I sentence you to transportation for life, whatever that"s worth to the sulfur mines on the island of Sicily.
I can"t be killed.
He meant me to live.
Deliberately he did it.
No killing Barabbas.
No death for Barabbas.
He died in my place.
The death has been paid.
He"s taken my death.
That"s it. He"s taken my death.
That light, that wasn"t light.
The dark, that wasn"t dark. That wasn"t dark, that was life.
-That was life.
-Take the man away.
You"ll die and rot, but I"ll live forever!
I"ve got my life and you can"t take it!
You stinking fish!
I"ve got my life and you can"t have it!
I"ve got my life!
-Well, which are you?
-l"m Scorpus.
That means nothing, idiot.
What"s your number?
-563.
-That"s better.
564.
-Who"s the god?
-The divine Emperor Tiberius.
You have the privilege of being his property.
Move.
565.
Go on, move.
That"s all.
Move on.
Next two.
Put your back to it.
Move.
Get your feet on the ground.
What are they doing?
They"re sending us down to the next level to make room for you.
That"s how you know how long you"ve been here by how deep you"re down.
They break you in gradually to get used to the dark.
Wait.
You"ve gotten used to the dark.
Did it take long?
Long enough.
It"s got into me.
Come here.
What do you see?
You"re blind.
Sulfur burns.
Dig.
Here.
You"ve got a partner there that seems to know how to live forever.
Better learn from him.
How long has it been?
Who was emperor then?
Tiberius?
That was long ago.
Almost in another world.
Here, I"m called Sahak.
That"s mine.
Here.
Move!
You make this even a worse hell than it is.
You don"t care how I got here but I"ll tell you.
The ship I was serving on took on a cargo of slaves.
Some of them got free.
Slipped over the side, during my watch.
So, the captain put the chains on me.
What about your world?
What"s your name?
-l asked you what your name is.
-All right.
If it"s going to keep you quiet.
Barabbas.
What are you saying?
Barabbas.
What"s the town you came from?
Jerusalem.
Are you the man they acquitted?
What is that to you?
Chained to you, of all men on Earth.
That"s what I like to see, devils and beasts going for each other"s throats.
Here"s a head of you to hate each other.
Now work, you crazy dogs.
Let"s see you working.
Work!
Get out!
Move!
You hate my name.
You hate the sound of it.
You weren"t even in Jerusalem, but you hate my name.
That"s right.
We hate it.
What does it matter?
What does it matter to you?
-You know who was killed in your place?
-Still that?
So, why shouldn"t we hate your name?
I thought what he said was to love one another.
I can"t imagine he expects a man to have a spirit as strong and patient as a dray horse.
It was only something I was told.
If you think I got the best of it, you stay here for a generation or two.
We"ve got a special duty for you two.
This"ll show you what happens to fighting mongrels. Come on.
Why isn"t it all forgotten?
That"s what I don"t understand.
Who"s been spreading things about?
Keeping that tale alive all these years?
What could kill it?
When you think it was God"s will come to Earth to show what he is.
I can see the reality of that.
Which is why the name of the Master goes on growing in the world.
I began to meet it wherever I sailed:
Phoenicia, Cyprus, Greece.
Even at the Port of Rome.
I began to understand what it meant.
But it"s a tough demand, the will of God.
I"m a poor hand at it.
And look where l"ve got us now.
Even though I"ve got his sign scratched on the back of the Emperor"s head.
It means I belong to him, not to the Emperor.
It"s the sign he has put on us all, if we give way enough to see it.
Look at this.
There"s the shape of the cross.
Keep your God to yourself.
Why did you come here and rake up old lies about killing God?
What"s going on down there?
Move yourselves or I"ll leave you to rot.
Pull!
You think what it"s like to me.
You"re the only man I"ve met who saw him.
You were there at the beginning, and you won"t talk.
You won"t tell me.
-What are you afraid of?
-Nothing I"m afraid of.
Then you can tell me.
You see the darkness that went over heaven and Earth when he died?
Suppose l did.
The man died in a dust storm, the same as anybody"s death.
Suppose his tomb was empty.
Can"t a dead man be taken away?
You want the truth?
I"ll give it to you.
That"s all of your God you"ll get out of me.
Here, what"s the matter?
Come on, get up.
If they see you can"t work they take you and you won"t come back.
Hey! Away!
All right, wake up.
-Come on. Move out, all of you. -Get on your feet.
You"ve had your sleep.
-You two, get your feet on the ground.
-Get out of there.
Come on. Move!
Root yourselves out! Move, I say!
Wake up.
All right, there"s work to be done.
-You"ve had enough sleep now.
Come on, you!
You, over there.
Wake up, you hear me?
-Get on your feet, I say.
-One dead man here.
I said get on your feet, all of you. Now come on.
Up on your feet.
-You"ve got to look as if you can work.
-What"s the matter with you?
You can"t stand up?
Can"t work?
I can work.
Here, this one"s no use.
-How many survivors? -None, sir.
There can"t be any.
-lt was like the end of the world to them.
-The end of the underworld.
-What did you say, sir?
-Nothing.
Survivors!
Over here. Survivors.
Get ready to receive survivors!
Away.
Pull!
When they"ve recovered, put them to work in the fields.
I can taste the salt in the air.
Every breath of wind is full of the sea.
I thought I could never love it better than I did.
But, oh, glory!
After the darkness of the mines I could go and drown in it like a man besotted.
Now, are you glad to live?
What?
Like a damned ox?
Salt me down and I"d praise God even for this.
How many times were you swindled in those foreign ports?
You must"ve been the easiest game they ever got their hands on.
-Why is that?
-You"d fall for any trick.
One smile and you trust the world that half kills you.
Yes, I trust it.
It has to be hard going or else how will the strength come that God has wanted?
God should make himself plain or leave me alone.
Am I the one who lets himself be swindled, or you?
Every time he came near, you refused to believe it.
But it"s never been out of your mind.
What other man"s death could have troubled you so long?
Stop there.
Pull over to the side.
Rock to be carried.
Here.
It"s a poor scratching, but the true sign.
Now will you leave me in peace?
All right, we go on.
Wait.
Julia, there are the two men I was telling you about.
Send for them, Rufio. I want to see them.
-Bring those men over here to us.
-Very good, sir.
Stop!
These two. Take them off the plough.
Two men so strangely come up from the underworld.
Twenty years in the mines, the old one. Indestructible.
I heard so.
You"ve earned the air you breathe, you two, by sheer good fortune.
-What are your names?
-Sahak, sir.
-And yours?
-Barabbas.
What"s your age?
What does it matter?
Indeed, what should it matter?
We understand you mean to live forever.
I must touch them for the luck that"s in them.
My wife thinks your merit is contagious.
All right, we don"t want to hold up the work.
Back now.
It"s from the Emperor.
It seems the gods approve your superstition.
We"re to call to Rome.
-To Rome?
What does it mean?
-l"m to enter the Senate.
-We"re to rise in the world.
-Rufio. Rome!
It"s true. They are charmed.
We must always take them with us.
A good thing I touched them.
I see, their success, not mine.
Nothing but amiable days from now on, and knowing everybody instead of nobody.
-When shall we go?
-Ride with us. I"ll give you the answer.
How wretched to arrive when all have gone to the mountains....
Look over there.
Well, here we have to leave your luck to learn its business.
What do you mean?
Why do we come here?
They cannot fight yet. They must first learn the skill.
And so they will.
But here we have to deliver them over.
Let"s hope they won"t disgrace us.
When a charmed life turns professional, we can expect great things.
Flacus, the Commander.
You honor Rome and us.
Our happiness is all here, Commander.
Unsurpassable.
The Emperor has given him his freedom three times.
There"s the third staff of liberty in his hand.
Always he prefers to come back.
He knows his empire and has the sense to keep it.
Keep it he does.
He"s taken a fair toll of them.
Torvald, the Senator Rufio and his lady.
I"ll take this life.
Can"t a man be made mad by the smell of blood?
A man can understand this.
To throw the net, hold it to your right, like this.
Then throw from the tips of your fingers, like this.
Your places now.
One here, you here and you over there.
Now, start your practice.
Throw your nets.
What"s this?
Have they mistaken this place for an old men"s hospital?
The gray-haired one?
They say there"s something remarkable about him.
Nothing can kill him.
Show me what you can do, grandfather.
What do we do with aging fish, grandfather?
It"s time he was thrown to the gulls.
Let me be.
Hit!
One!
Hit!
Two!
You move on.
Bring out the first group of gladiators.
You remember me?
You drew the sign of the Master beside my plate.
How did you know I carried the sign?
Several days I"ve watched you breaking the bread.
Can we speak freely?
He was there in Jerusalem. He knew the Master.
God be praised and keep you safe.
The days have been getting darker for us.
Persecution increasing.
The Emperor wants to destroy every trace of us.
But tomorrow, when the games are over and the sun is down discipline will be lax and there may be a chance for me to lead you to where we meet.
The Master"s disciple, Peter, is here in Rome.
Seldom enough I find my way there, some way off to the catacombs.
The catacombs?
Surely it"s the dead who meet there.
It may seem to you that the faith is buried.
But so is the seed before there can be a harvest.
First group, assemble.
You shall see tomorrow the life we keep there.
First group, assemble.
-Did you hear him, Barabbas?
-l heard.
One, two, one, two....
To your fighting places.
Go.
When you"ve taken up these positions tomorrow the trumpets will sound.
And from above you, there the white cloth will be thrown into the arena.
When it touches the ground, the contest will begin.
To make sure you understand, this is the way it will happen.
Kill him!
Kill him!
-That"s an angry crowd.
-They want blood.
They were driven to a frenzy by Sahak, who wouldn"t kill his man.
If the Emperor were here, he wouldn"t have had a choice.
Wait till tomorrow.
He"ll get his quota of killing, if you"re lucky to win.
-Not one life will he get from me.
-Won"t he?
Say that to the Emperor.
He will teach you the ways.
-When he says death, death it is.
-The true God says life.
-l only answer to him.
-Hark at this man.
By God, if he contradicts the Emperor....
-Who do you call your God?
-The only one.
The rest are inventions of fear, tales taken from the past they can no more help you than this breast can bleed.
Put "em down.
-insulting the gods before we go fight.
-What revenge will Mars take?
None at all. He doesn"t exist.
Mars doesn"t exist?
What do you mean, he doesn"t exist?
Will you keep your mouth shut?
The real God is greater than any man"s thoughts can imagine.
He made life as deep and strong as the sea.
Your gods are as shallow as a reeking pond.
He"s above us and around us, in us.
Like the breath in our bodies.
And he has one law that will break our pattern.
The law is love.
Whatever we do that breaks that law condemns us.
And so that we should see what his love is he sent his son to live the life of a man.
To show that God understands the life he has made.
-Who spun you this?
-What do you want us to do?
What good will he do us in the arena?
We"ll lose the goodwill of the gods we know.
Tomorrow in the arena, show the Emperor that we know what life"s worth.
Throw away your weapons.
Do you think all the things of the Earth and the heavens have been made for no other reason except we should eat and make money and spawn children and kill and die?
What a purpose for creation!
If anything"s beyond belief, that is.
God said, ""Burn away the old world...
""...and let a new one rise from the ashes.""
As the Son of God rose from the dead, he died for us.
Ask Barabbas here the truth of what I tell you.
He saw with his own eyes the Son of God when he lived among us.
Saw him die.
Was there, in the garden, on the third morning.
You saw him, Barabbas?
-Tell us what you saw.
-What happened?
A long time ago I saw a man.
Some people say he was...
-...the Son of God.
-Enough!
You"ve condemned yourselves.
I charge you with sedition and stirring up mutiny.
You"re both under arrest.
Take them out and put them in chains.
Move now!
Let me be sure you understand the seriousness of the charge against you.
Not only with holding views proscribed by the State for which the punishment is death, but of recommending those views to men sworn to the State"s service.
What is more, you"ve betrayed your faith to me who brought you to this city and laid me under possible suspicion of connivance in the eyes of the Emperor.
The prospect is black for you.
You know what this is?
-The stamp of the Roman State.
-Which means that you"re Rome"s property.
What"s this cut here?
The sign of my master.
-Who do you call your master?
-The one who is my lord.
-The Son of the Father.
-ln other words, the Christian sign?
A religion which sets itself up to menace government and order.
Which denies the divine authority of the Emperor.
Which preaches that the slave is equal to the free man and would reduce society to anarchy.
A rebellious, insufferable doctrine.
Give me a direct answer.
Do you belong to the State?
I belong to the Lord, my god.
So, you also believe in this god?
Tell me, do you?
You don"t?
Then why do you bear his name on your disc?
Isn"t he your god?
Isn"t that what the inscription means?
I have no god.
I don"t understand.
Why then do you bear this sign of Jesus Christ, scratched on your disc?
Because I tried to believe.
I"ll give you the opportunity to recover your senses.
If you"ll admit publicly to the men you spoke to that all these things were lies, you may save your life.
Will you do this?
That would be to lose my life, not save it.
What I am is his.
But isn"t life dear to you?
Yes, it is.
And you understand the cruel death that punishes mutiny and sedition?
What do you choose?
I choose my god.
Then there is no more I can do for you.
Guilty of the charge. Execution at sunrise.
You"re as mad as your god.
You, come here.
Unwise to carry around with you what you don"t believe in.
It may be the Master means you to live.
He may have some greater need of you.
Some other purpose, Barabbas.
-Something else.
-Take him away.
Guards.
Now you"ll have to be worth two men to take his place.
You may go.
You are to witness the punishment of this man so that there can be no doubt in your mind that the words he spoke to you were a gross breach of the law.
An iniquitous crime against the State.
Not only lies, but treasonable lies which were not only aimed at spreading rebellion among you but also to pervert your minds from those acceptable religions on which the State is built.
Any man who thinks that those words are harmless or thinks that he can repeat or conform to such words as this man spoke let him take warning from the punishment you are about to witness.
Long live the Emperor!
Proceed, Torvald.
Positions.
Ready.
Throw.
Traitors and fools!
You"ll wish this was better done.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Gladiator Barabbas, you"re becoming quite a legend among us, I hear.
For your remarkable persistence in life we have a traditional answer to this public acclaim.
We make you a free man.
We give you your liberty.
Here is the symbol of your freedom.
I brought him to you.
This is where he would have wanted to be buried.
Our brother Sahak.
So you had to carry your dead conscience here.
Did he have to die before you cared about him?
Are you more concerned with his body than his life?
You were willing to let him go to his death alone.
Why should you help him now he doesn"t need you?
How could I have helped him by being killed?
He made his own death.
What good has it done?
I had to go on living, he said.
-There was something I still had to do.
-Barabbas, why should you believe it?
When the light shone, you wouldn"t accept it.
When the dark came, you denied it.
When the spirit of God beckoned, you refused it.
When Sahak says your life is kept for some purpose why should you believe it?
To make a gag for your conscience, is that it?
You believe it because it suits you.
Or maybe if Sahak stood before you now then you would say you believed. You would repent and love God.
It would be easy.
But what strength would your belief have then?
What would it matter?
Jesus of Nazareth was killed instead of me.
There must have been a reason.
Why me?
Why did he choose me?
Where have you gone?
You!
Where are you?
Wait for me.
Wait!
You wait!
For God"s sake, where are you?
Show me the way!
I"m lost!
Which way shall I go?
-What"s happening?
-Rome is burning.
Can"t you see?
Rome is burning.
-What happened to make the fire?
-The Christians tried to burn down Rome.
-Move!
Move that case. Come on.
-Christians?
-The Christians are burning Rome!
-lt"s the Christians!
Fire!
They"re burning away the old world.
The new kingdom is coming.
God.
You won"t find me failing this time.
What are you doing, madman?
Fire of God destroying the old world.
The hour has come when all is to perish.
-Are you a Christian?
-Yes, I am.
And I"m ready for Him!
The whole world will soon be ablaze.
Do you hear that?
We"re burning the way.
We"re ready for his coming.
-Take him away.
-The Master!
-The Master"s coming to build a new world.
-Away!
Let me go!
I must make ready for his coming!
Let me go!
Here!
Get yourself out of this one.
Here"s one of your kind who was caught in the act, setting light to a storehouse.
He admits he"s a Christian, burning the city to start a new kingdom.
The only honest man among you.
Who are you?
We"ve never seen you before.
is it true?
Were you setting fire to a storehouse?
Yes.
-We"ve never seen you before.
-Who are you?
My name is Barabbas.
-Barabbas, the robber.
-Barabbas, the acquitted.
This burning city is no work of ours.
This isn"t how the new kingdom is going to be made.
You were wrong.
Who are you to tell me I"m wrong?
Many years ago we spoke together.
You remember?
No.
You asked me why I was making a net so far from the sea.
Jerusalem.
The street of the potters.
You were mistaken of us then as you are again now.
We didn"t set fire to the city.
You"ve done the work of the wild beast, the Emperor.
-Are you a lunatic?
-lt was his fire, you fool, not God"s.
Why can"t God make himself plain?
What"s become of all the fine hopes?
The trumpets, the angels?
All the promises?
Every time I"ve seen it end up the same way, with torments and dead bodies with no good come of it.
All for nothing.
Do you think they persecute us to destroy nothing?
Or do you think that what has battered on your soul for twenty years has been nothing?
It wasn"t for nothing that Christ died.
Mankind isn"t nothing.
In his eyes, each individual man is the whole world.
He loves each man as though there were no other.
I was the opposite of everything he taught, wasn"t l?
Why did he let himself be killed instead of me?
Because being farthest from him, you were the nearest.
-l"m no nearer than I was before.
-Nor any farther away.
The truth of the matter is, he"s never moved from your side.
I can tell you this.
There has been a wrestling in your spirit, back and forth in your life which in itself is knowledge of God. By the conflict you have known him.
I can tell you as well, that so it will be with the coming of the kingdom.
That wrestling back and forth and the laboring of the world spirit like a woman in childbirth.
We are only the beginning.
We won"t see the time when the Earth is full of the kingdom.
And yet, even now, even here we are at the end ourselves.
The kingdom is within us.
There is nothing more to fear.
Upon us, the years will be built.
Many years, many martyrdoms.
The ground of men is very stubborn to mature.
But men will look back to us in our day and will wonder and remember our hope.
It is the end of the day.
We shall trust ourselves to a little pain and sleep.
Saying to the world:
""God"s speed.""
What hour is it?
Night or day?
The sixth hour goes when darkness....
Darkness....
l give myself up into your keeping.
It is Barabbas.

SOMNAMBULISM
A Collected Edition by the University of Upsala
His specialty.
THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI.
In the year 1783, a mystic by the name of Caligari toured the fairs of numerous villages in northern Italy, accompanied by a somnambulist named Cesare.
...for months he sowed panic amongst village folks through a series of foul murders committed under almost identical circumstances he had entirely subjugated to his will a somnambulist named Cesare, whom he did compel to carry out his nefarious schemes.
A puppet, the exact likeness of Cesare, and which took his place in a cabinet, allowed him to divert any suspicion that might fall on the somnambulist.
My diary.
12 March... Finally... finally!
A somnambulist has been brought to the asylum for admission...
Afternoon - My desire...
I shall be able to satisfy my life's unwavering wish...!
Now I shall unravel the psychiatric secrets of this Caligari!
Now I shall discover if it is true that a somnambulist can be compelled to perform acts that in a walking state he would never commit and would be repugnant to him...
Whether it is true that a sleepwalker can be led to commit even murder...
An obsession.
I must know everything...
I must penetrate his secrets.
I must become Caligari...
YOU MUST BECOME CALIGARI
END OF ACT V
ACT VI
We found the sleepwalker out in the fields...
Mr. Director - unmask yourself.
You are Dr. Caligari!
...and from that day on, the madman never again left his cell.
Look... there's Cesare... never allow him to tell your fortune, or you're dead...
Jane...
I love you...
won't you be my wife at last?
We queens are not free to answer the call of our heart...
You all think that - I'm insane!
It isn't true...
It's the director who's insane!
He is Caligari... Caligari... Caligari!
At last I understand his delusion.
He thinks I am that mystic, Caligari...!
Now I know exactly how to cure him...
THE END
ALGOL (Tragedy of Power)
ALGOL Prologue
High and far away shines the star Algol, the mystery of the sky...
From time immemorial to this day, the star dims every third night at 10 and shines again the fourth night.
The Greek astrologers called it the Demon.
The Arab sky scholars called it Algol, The Demon's Eye.
Deep inside, the children of the day break coal exhaling hot gases.
The worker Robert Herne.
Three hours, Robert, and we start a new day.
Never comes the day, Maria Obal!
My day is where you are, Robert!
On that day, Leonore Nissen becomes greater age and, as sole heir of his father, she receives from her tutors the coal mine.
I thank my tutors and directors for the faithful service when I take the direction of the mine.
My first priority will be those who are working for me far from the light of day.
I want to go down today!
I come to you as a sister!
There is no alternative for us.
Once again, the light of Algol faded.
Deep within the mountain, the Demon's Gallery abandoned and avoided for bad conditions.
My name is Algol!
I'm the new replacement worker and I came here to report to you.
All those who work for me will be my guests tomorrow a day of joy in the sunlight. From the mountains on my way home, I'm deeply moved by what I saw.
Leonore Nissen.
I want this to be proclaimed in every house in the mining town and in all wells and tunnels.
My new replacement worker, Algol.
He doesn't have a shelter!
... ...If you allow it and accept, he could live in the attic.
This is my home, inherited from my parents.
Welcome!
Tomorrow, at break time!
Peter Hell, a childhood friend of Robert and Mary.
All those who work for me will be my guests tomorrow a day of joy in the sunlight. From the mountains on my way home, I'm deeply moved by what I saw.
Leonore Nissen.
Charity!
Should we think as bad as you?
Bye!
I'm not going to the party.
I'm going to travel.
The lovely lady is very generous.
Tell me all about those people.
From their fears to their wishes and what they think.
I'm not a toy for your whims!
I'm not kidding.
I bring all that I have!
If there is any way to take me to your world, I won't get there by taking your hand!
I'll bring her home, she isn't well!
I fear for us, Robert.
Once I would have saved a person like her!
Give me a light, Robert.
I want to read my books.
And Robert didn't find peace...
A thousand roads lead to the light.
Don't be afraid, Algol will take you away from the troubles of the night.
It will be yours the Earth's might.
Algol takes you away from the troubles of the night!
Only a year and you'll rule the world!
To my assistant in the hour of my death.
Doctor Crane.
From the star Algol to the Earth.
No one knows, no one knew before me of these waves.
With my little machine I detected them for the first time.
Which were intensified with the power of the whole world.
A thousand roads lead to the light!
Don't be afraid, Algol will take you away from the troubles of the night!
it will be yours the Earth's might!
I have given you the power!
You have twelve months time!
End of Prologue
ALGOL 1st reel.
The year passed.
I'm coming, Robert Herne.
Exclusive:
The puzzle of factories Herne about to be solved!
The mysterious constructions which were built by engineer Robert Herne six months ago, will be ready just before his inauguration Presumably, the plant uses all current facilities for energy production.
All technical stocks plummet!
The status of the share prices will be announced after the end of the day.
The State Department advises the exploration of new coal mines.
Bios-City.
Your Excellency and the State Department are invited to visit this morning my Bio-Factories, given the intention of the Government to open new coal mines Robert Herne.
The Board of the Stock Exchange requests a meeting.
If the rumors are not just a speculation the State is obliged to intervene.
The State Department accepts the invitation.
Robert Herne, creator of the Bio-Factories.
The State Department accepts the invitation.
Maria:
The year is passed.
I'm opening the Bio-Factories tomorrow Call me and I'll come get you.

I won't be coming anymore, Robert Herne!
Your machine frightens me and I worried about you.
Maria.
The Hall of Eternal Energy.
Maria Obal is working the night shift.
If you want to see her, Peter Hell, I'll take you to her.
I'll come another time, Maria Obal, to take your life!
Devil? !
Yes, that's what I will be from now on!
I won't be coming anymore, Robert Herne!
Your machine frightens me and I worried about you.
Maria.
I was lucky.
I come from a neighboring country, where men live behind the plow.
I'll take you if you want.
Give me time, Peter Hell!
The inauguration of the Bio-Factories.
At this time, our neighbour Robert Herne inaugurates his mysterious Central.
Until now, our invitation has not arrived.
The world without coal... now we are free!
We will return to the sun.
Idiot!
Yes, you would be in the sun and die of hunger!
What does that mean?
This means that your mines would stop forever.
And you are without bread!
From this hall, my engine will distribute its energy through a thousand cables across the world. The rule of coal is done.
From today, the Bio-Factories will provide energy to the world.
No one will enter this hall but me.
The secret remains mine!
I know what I owe to the country!
Half of the benefits belongs to our people!
We'll run out of bread and also those who will come after us Then give us what you have!
Take everything I own!
The Nissen mine is in turmoil and the owner is threatened.
Brothers and sisters!
Abandon the mines!
The daybreak dawns!
... ...You will no longer work, but you will not be without bread.
Our country will be great and happy. Money from around the world will belongs to us.
And you, citizens of this country, will be free and rich!
I destroyed your property, but I will get you a new one!

And the power cables of the Bio-Factories spread across the world...
The founder of Bio-Factories, Robert Herne, is the master of the world.
I did what I promised to the country:
Today, after 20 years all the countries work for ours.
Using the eternal energy that my factories churn out, to power their industries.
Greet your father!
In the grain-growing neighbouring land, lives Maria Obal, Peter Hell's widow, whose son is the living image of his father and the joy of his mother!
Mother, why did you leave that happy land, the great and rich country of Robert Herne?
Don't ask! We don't need Robert Herne.
He enslaves all other countries We grow fruits and cereals, all by working!
I will announce the names of the twelve men chosen at random to operate the Bio-Factories the next year for the good of our country and for all peoples of the world.
Reginald Herne!
Miss Yella Ward, a rich foreigner, who lives to party.
On this day, the government of Maria Obal country made a serious decision.
Our coal mines are almost exhausted.
We have to buy electricity from Herne and paid for it in wheat!
Here is the telegram to Robert Herne!
The letter seals the fate of our country.
Where is Reginald?
The Council of the Republic, has decided to participate in the inexhaustible energy program.
For 25 years the Bio-Factories have produced energy for the world, we now ask you, Robert Herne, as a last resort to power our peasant land.
As the last link in the chain, we joined the world for the good of my country!
And Reginald Herne...
If Reginald Herne have an hour for a woman who loves him he should meet me tonight at 9 in the lobby of the Hotel Grant.
The power of the Earth is mine!
There is a curse in your Central.
Share its secrets with me!
Only one will know it- my heir, Reginald!
A push from my hand and all the world's wheels will stop Me and my dynasty are the masters of the world.
Strangely compelling knowledge.
Put your horse in the stable.

Country of blinds!
The machines will drown you!
Reginald Herne - heir of the world!

He has deceived us enough.
He should provide electricity for free.
...To the Government!
We won't be servants for Robert Herne any longer.
We have to honor the contracts, we no longer need coal and electricity.
I'll go to see Robert Herne and urge him to free his Central to all mankind.

To Robert Herne!
In service to Robert Herne!
I'm Magda, Robert Herne's daughter!
I've come to Robert Herne to urge him to free his Central to all mankind.

Son of Maria Obal, be my guest.
You know who I am and what my Central is!
This is your heritage!

The whole world pays homage to the most powerful man.
I'll come to the party in workers uniform.
I urge Robert Herne to finish with his secret!
I call on the master of the world to free his Central for the salvation of mankind, or I will destroy it!
Give your work to humanity or I'll go with him!
You can't destroy the greatest advance man has created!
Take me to your country!

The cost of the project...
Decree.
The Country of Herne has decided to divert the Val River to its own cost.
The Free State must provide half of its able-bodied men for the work immediately.
I fear for you and your Central!
When are you going to reveal me your secret?
This new work is colossal and will exhaust your strength Give the weight of your domain to someone younger... your son!
Get out of my sight!
Decree

The Free State must provide half of its able-bodied men for the work immediately.

THE END
How he came into the world pictures based on events in an old chronicle by Paul wegener five chapters directed by Paul wegener set design by professor hans poelzig costume design by rochus gliese cinematography by Karl freund characters rabbi low:
Loni nest a strange creature, called the "golem" Paul wegener union-film for ufa chapter one
The stars reveal to the revered rabbi low that the Jewish community is threatened by severe harm.
I must speak with rabbi jehuda, our people are facing an impending calamity.
Summon all the community elders, so they will pray at the temple to Jehova throughout the night.
Disaster is written in the stars!
We will no longer ignore the many serious charges brought up against the Jews. They crucified our lord, capably disregard the holy Christian festivities, lust for the property and blood of their fellow men, and are able to use black magic.
Hence we decree that all Jews evacuate their quarter known as the ghetto before the new moon.
Squire florian, you must deliver our edict to the Jewish quarter immediately.
Venus is entering the libran constellation.
The time has come for the invocation to be successful.
To save my people I must wrest the crucial life-giving word from the dreaded spirit astaroth, that will bring the golem to life.
An envoy from the emperor is waiting outside.
If there is any compassion within your young heart, you will accompany me to revered rabbi low.
He incarnates the heart and voice of our Jewish community.
I was the one who drew up the emperor's horoscope, and twice I have warned him of danger.
Now go and tell him that I have a secret message for him.
End of chapter one chapter two
The hour has come.
The alignment of the celestial bodies now favors the invocation of the spell.
Can you keep a secret from anyone?
Squire florian delivers a new message from the emperor.
In memory of your services, we will Grant you an audience.
Come to the Rose festival at the castle and amuse us again with your magic arts.
Soon you will have a guardian.
This figure named the "go/em" was created in classical times by a thessalonian sorcerer.
If the life-awakening word is placed in the amulet on his chest, he will be alive as long as he wears it.
This symbol is called the "shem".
Who could know the word?
Necromancie:
The art of bringing dead beings to life
astaroth is the guardian of a life-giving word that will awaken any and everything, whether corpse or man's creation. Whoever possesses the key of Solomon and knows the "great spell"
can compel astaroth to reveal the word insofar as he awaits an auspicious constellation of celestial bodies.
The hour has come!
Astaroth!
Astharoth, appear! Appear!
Name the word!
On behalf of the lord of the spirits, name the word!
The word, that terrible life-giving word. I have snatched it from the evil, dark powers that be.
I shall now call the golem to life.
End of chapter two chapter three a strange servant.
That's my new servant.
Golem's first errand.
He is the rabbi's new servant, who is mute.
He will come here every day in my stead, from now on.
Give him always everything on the list and he will do you no harm.
I have been invited to the castle today.
You will mind the house.
The golem comes with me, as I want to show him to the emperor.
The festival of roses.
When your father arrives at the castle I will steal away from the festival.
I have bribed the gatekeeper:
Place a lamp in the window as a sign that you are waiting for me.
He is my servant and my creation.
He is called golem. I cannot say any more than this.
What a phantasmagoria you are displaying before our eyes, you strange illusionist.
Let us see more of your arts.
Let me show you our Jewish forefathers, o mighty emperor, so you better come to know our people.
But there is a requirement: Nobody is allowed to speak a word or to laugh. Othennise a terrible calamity can happen.
Ahasverus, the wandering Jew.
Save me and I will pardon your people!
End of chapter three chapter four
The emperor has pardoned all Jews, we are saved.
Awaken our sleeping brothers with the joyous sounds of the shofar!
I know it for sure! The watchman told me himself.
Revered rabbi low has returned from the emperor, bearing the pardon.
Rejoice ye, rejoice ye!
If you brought an inanimate being to life through magic, beware of your creation.
When uranus enters the house of the planets, astaroth will reclaim his instrument.
Then the lifeless Clay will turn against the master, intent on deceit and destruction.
Golem, your task is accomplished.
Once again become dead Clay, as you have been before. Othennise the dark power will have its vengeance.
Master, master!
Revered rabbi low!
Jehuda is waiting below with the community elders to escort you to the temple for prayer of thanks.
As soon as everyone will be at the temple, you can sneak away.
Mirjam has not heard yet. She is sleeping.
I cannot open the door now, just go ahead!
No, no, I will wait.
I want to accompany you to the temple.
A strange man is inside her chamber.
Chase him away!
End of chapter four chapter five
Your house is in flames. The golem rages!
The demon!
The demon takes mirjam away with him.
He will annihilate everything.
Save us, rabbi!
Recite the fire spell or we shall all perish!
The revered rabbi low has saved our people for the second time.
Let us all gather at the gate to thank him there.
Revered rabbi low, the people are all coming.
Thank you for exorcising the fire.
Can you forgive me?
The rabbi's house lies ruined in ashes, and every trace of the stranger has been extinguished.
No one suspects anything and I will keep quiet.
The golem, the golem!
Where is the golem?
The gate is broken. It was done by the golem.
Give all thanks to Jehova. He has saved his people for the third time today.

There's Seppl!
...and it's my bad luck that nobody wants to marry Liesel.
You just have to marry Liesel first.
She'll soon kick you out, and then you marry Gretel.
You're a smart guy!
And you're a simpleton!
That must be Xaver!
Seppl had a splendid idea.
Now we have to put on a performance.
So...
Now I want to make a proposal to Liesel.
I'm not responsible for accidents and physical injuries.
Liesel, I want to marry you!
Come to your senses!
How did you finish up?
Cold and wet!
I like you more and more!
"He who truly loves a maid To suffer pain, is unafraid."
When we're married I won't be so nice to you.
A wedding in Kohlhiesel's inn.
End of Act 3
Kohlhiesel's Daughters Act 4
It's your fault that Xaver and Liesel are married.
Do you think that Xaver is going to marry me?
How unlucky we are!
Let me help you bear your sorrow!
Darling Gretel!
I write because I want to see you.
Meet me tomorrow evening.
Xaver
I simply have no luck!
But you have a good appetite.
You do kiss nicely!
You haven't seen me get really furious yet.
Take my boots off!
Bring me my slippers!
Don't you have anything to do?
I have so much love for him.
Don't talk such nonsense.
I love him so much!
This happened to you because you look like a frump.
This is how you should make yourself look!
Jumping Jehoshaphat!
Much better kisser than Gretel!
I am not going to be able to come to our appointment.
Xaver
Darling Xaver!
I am not going to be able to come to our appointment.
Best, Gretel
At the Rangdewuh Square
Quiet bliss.
The Flower of Love could find no more romantic spot in which to blossom than in this poet's Dream Garden.
I love you.
I love you 2.
Are you comfortable?
I know a better way than that to break his neck.
He's my son and I'll break his neck any way I please.
Babe Ruth is a bat.
That afternoon the young inventor tries his patent fly-swatter.
Come in!
They are going to have peace if they have to go to Court and fight for it.
Her father's abused her long enough. Now I want to marry her and take her home to my father.
Sign this bond to keep the peace.
We're going to get married.
After going to court to end their troubles they have a wedding to start more.
Wedding Presents Hands off!
What happened to you?
I bought a Ford.
Get the groom, the bride's out in the alley.
I 'm giving up single life I feel I'm losing something-
Where's the ring?
Straight from Woolworths.
ACME 5 and 10 cent Store
Father's watching, come and get me!
A victim of the city traffic.
It was young Dr. Feris' first serious case.
The injured child is still I unconscious of his fate.
I dared not wait any longer.
I amputated both legs above the knee.
There is a contusion at the base of the skull.
Good God!
You should not have amputated!
You have mangled this poor child for life.
His father and mother...
My poor boy, I will do what I can for you.
I shall lie for you, and may Got forgive me.
Only immediate amputation could save your child's life.
I heard them say...
He imagines he heard us.
It's the effect of the ether.
He lies!
He lies!
Twenty seven years later...
San Francisco is the richest city in the western world.
She has one hideous blemish...
The Barbary Coast.
Barbary Nell.
Frisco Pete.
Blizzard, lord and master of the underworld.
Lichtenstein, of the Federal Secret Service.
Rose, his most daring operative.
Rose, this detail I'm offering you is so dangerous, I hope you will turn it down.
It' s always Blizzard, that cripple from Hell.
Do you remember sweet Barbary Nell who wandered from our fold?
She' s dead!
I could get him for theft, arson, murder, but his criminal machine would still grind on.
Through the Master I must reach his slave, the underground powers of the Reds.
He' s gathered up his dance hall girls and he' s put them to work in his house, making hats, thousands of hats.
I must know why!
"I believe Blizzard is hatching something so big, it endangers the city.
I must find out what!
By the way, Barbary Nell, who strayed from us, now sleeps upon a marble stab  in the morgue.
Blizzard' s favorite for the moment.
A woman who enters that den risks worse than death.
That' s all in the day' s work.
... and I shall walk as men walk.
I shall be the master of a city!
"And for my mangled years the city shall pay me  with the pleasures of a Nero and the powers of a Caesar!
But you won' t live to see it... if you don' t pedal better.
It means living in that devil' s house till you find out what he' s up to.
Of course.
Well, I' m game.
Dr. Ferris, now the most famous surgeon in his line.
Dr. Wilmot Allen, his assistant.
Blizzard had agents in strange places.
Barbara asked me to call for her.
The surgeon' s daughter Barbara, had dedicated herself to Art.
I' m dreadfully discouraged.
I have done nothing worth while.
Some day she will realize that this is all nonsense.
Sorry you have to go.
Haven' t I waited long enough?
Why don' t you chuck it, Barbara?
Not until I have done at least one thing that is worth doing.
And I' m going to do Satan, after the fall'.
If I fail  I will marry you.
Nothing to report.
Blizzard keeps plans to himself.
His people obey orders not knowing their meaning. My knowledge of music has been my protection.
He likes my pedaling.
Rose has been there a week...
and she' s learned nothing.
You' re a find!
You are not afraid of me...
you look me in the eyes.
How could I be afraid...
when you play like that?
You are a find!
WANTED
- Model to pose of "Satan After the Fall".
If you thing look like Satan, apply at studio of Barbara Ferris, 32 Institute Place.
Be in front of that studio tomorrow and see that no applicant but myself enters it.
Everything comes to him who waits.
You have mangled this poor child for life.
Do I look like Satan?
Before I am through with her and her father, they' think I' m the devil himself.
9 A.M, Barbara' s Studio at 32 Institute Place.
Model already engaged.
Bubbles, a street waif whom Barbara has befriended.
Whenever Blizzard was absent, Rose hunted for clues.
Some excellent judges think that I resemble Satan.
If there is enough of me.
I seem to please.
I knew about when I was bumming the streets cat-throat' s his middle name.
You ought not touch him with a pole.
Gawd!
Look at that face!
If I could catch that expression in the day... I' d be famous.
How do you happen to know so much about Art?
My father, who shall be nameless, was a distinguished man.
But he detested little boys with their legs clipped off.
So at fifteen I hoppled out of his life.
I could write a better treatise on sculpture myself.
Why do you live in the underworld?
When Satan fell from Heaven he looked for power in Hell.
Hugely satisfied with his morning s work.
Rose, my dear!
Under the piano my darling...
we will have some music.
I have a feeling I shall waft you into Heaven.
A death song, Rose!
Rose was my best bet...
so far she' s learned nothing.
"I could not have played that way without your help.
Go back to work...
I can murder anything but music.
Days passed and the clay grew into the image of the man who was like Satan...
Into a face clothed with evil intent.
In time man would mangle the soul of the daughter, even as the father had mangled the body of the man.
The end of this passage is barred by a gate but through it I could see what...
But the most remarkable of all is a fully-equipped operating room.
If you say it' s good, I know it' s good.
But she hesitated for this would mean the end of Blizzard.
I know of Dr. Allen...
and of his great master, Dr. Ferris."
I will come tomorrow at the same time.
What an admirable pair of legs.
I gave mine to science.
That monster ought to be chloroformed and put out of the way.
He shows me only courtesy and helpfulness.
The end of this passage is barred by a gate, but through it I could see what...
Doctor Ferris investigates.
May I talk with Mr. Blizzard alone?
I have followed every step of your career, and you have indeed profited by your early mistakes.
You were the child whose life I ruined?
Don' t let that trouble you too deeply.
It is now in your power to repair your error.
Command me in any way...
But don' t come here any more.
Only your daughter' s request can keep me away.
She is making a masterpiece.
Barbara, let me tell you a story.
He lies!
He did not have to cut them off.
Behind his visits there is some sinister motive.
I can read it his eyes.
If you have made him what he is, it is all the more our duty to help him.
Blizzard' s man O'Hagan, his back in town.
He has organized thousands of disgruntled foreign laborers.
Hats and men... what' s the devil up to?
Blizzard' s chief lieutenant, O'Hagan.
You have worked in the dark long enough... this is the plan I have been developing for two years.
2 December
At twelve noon on that day I shall loot the City of San Francisco.
Your 10.000 foreign malcontents will filter into the city in small detachments.
The signal will be an explosion.
By fire and riots I shall draw the police and military into the suburbs.
The heart of the city will be left defenseless...
ours to loot at will.
And then we shall vanish with our treasure.
You talk as if you had legs!
By God!
You have gone mad!
Perhaps... but with the madness that succeeds!
Better come out of that closet or I will begin to shoot!
Crying won' t help...
talking may.
What the use...you' re going kill me anyhow.
I doubt it...
you' re the best pedaler I ever had.
But the most remarkable of all is a fully equipped operating room.
You see, you haven' t been allowed to do much damage.
I think I' m glad.
Don' t you see?
Master!
With exultation he felt the power that his mind was gaining over Barbara.
You are the best critic in the world.
Live your own life... go where I shall point... to your place among the stars.
How am I ever going to thank you the help you have given me?
When you have finished that, don' t give me op.
I love you, Barbara, with my whole heart and soul.
At her laugh his Hell - born loose passions broke.
But almost instantly he knew that he had blundered and like a good general tried retrieve his mistake.
I am the unhappiest beast in the world.
Forgive me having dared to lift my thoughts to you.
Laughter burns a cripple like acid.
I don' t know why I laughed.
You frightened me.
Will you forgive me?
I have come to prescribe a little, Barbara.
Call me a taxi.
True women need love, a home, children.
He has made you forget that.
I will marry you, dear, whenever you wish.
After a night of jealous fury, the Beast takes action.
Hello Doctor, this is Bubbles.
It' s about Barbara...
she' s gone to Blizzard' s house.
I do not know why she went.
She was crying.
He will run all the way...
on those magnificent legs.
Once before a woman surfeited me with her caresses.
She' s dead!
Rose just shows herself at the window and nods... and that' s all.
Where is Miss Ferris?"
She is probably in her room.
Shall I search your house, or will you take me to her?
Listen, my baffled hero...
if you wish the lady to go free  you must hand over to me your superb legs.
Dr. Ferris will cut them off for you.
Then he will graft them to me.
They will be very becoming.
Your daughter is in my house.
She has been hurt.
Cowmen at once.
That fairy tale about your daughter was merely to make certain that you' d come.
You' ve played the trick with apes... now I' m putting human beings at your service.
Your victim is fulfilling destiny in making you the master surgeon of the world.
You must make it possible...
unless you would have your charming daughter married to these.
Out of my house is not out of my power... that' s here.
Suppose you and your assistant should disappear... then your daughter and I...
Give me legs and I will be a model son-in-law.
Then I will be a tower of strength...
I will be a Caesar!
You are right...
you' d be a superman!
I will do it!
Doctor Ferris' sudden decision to operate brought about starling results.
I have waked from a terrible dream!
I was a devil...
I did things that I shudder to think of!
What' s happened...
you did not do what he wanted?
That was a madman' s request...
I operated on his head.
There is a contusion at the base of the skull.
That caused pressure on the brain... he has never been wholly responsible for his acts.
This man, let alone may become as great a power for good as he was for evil.
He shall have the chance.
The tyrant' s hand relaxed...
the whirlwind breaks.
Ôhe old Blizzard is no more.
I have assumed my real name
In my madness I built power from evil.
I shall undo my handwork.
I am still your friend, but it must be for better things.
He' s got religion...
that means he will raise Hell!
How do we know he won' t snitch on us?
If we don' t finish him, he will finish us.
The New Man... and his wife.
We shall do great things together.
Fate chained me to Evil...
for that I must pay the Penalty.
"That is a great puzzle, Perhaps I am going to see it solved.
Don' t grieve, dear...
death interests me.
All that' s left of him...
an evil mask of a great soul.
The End
THE PARSON'S WIDOW
Now, as a thousand years ago, the waterfall sings by the old Norwegian village.
If we listen closely, it tells a lot about the days gone by.
Hear, O hear my voice proclaim.
Come all ye from far and near.
I summon you to elect a parson. For we have no good shepherd here.
These two had wandered over the mountain from a neighboring parish...
Sofren had struggled through long student days and now he was applying for the vacant post.
Mari had waited faithfully during all the hard years.
Mari reminds Sofren that her father will not allow them to marry until Sofren is truly a parson.
Sofren's two rivals to the post had faith in their handsome clothes and the fine learning that was crammed into them in Copenhagen.
Each of the three candidates wished heartily for the Devil himself to take away the others.
"In the beginning, Man, unlike others creatures, was made in the image of God."
"But we must consider why it was that God made Man so perfect and magnificent..."
"I am going to speak to you about Balaam's ass and God's strange power --- by which He was able to open the jaws of a dumb animal so that it might speak like a man!"
"Now, two learned applicants have appeared here before me."
"One of them took us to Eden.
And that is as far back as we can go."
"Let him stay there!"
"The other one chose the text:
Am I Not An Ass? But what has an ass to do on the pulpit?"
"My friends, I will not take you to Eden --- you are too clever.
But I will take you to the bowels of the Earth, deep in the roaring jaws of Hell!"
"And so, my friends, beware that you are not swallowed up by the roaring jaws of Hell!"
The congregation had appointed five wise and trusted men to pass verdicts on the applicants.
When the two theologians from Copenhagen saw they could not reach their goal by words alone, they joined forces to invite everyone to a feast that evening.
Out of common decency, they were obliged to invite Sofren too.
At last, the verdict was Sofren.
"According to the law of our parish, the late parson's widow, Dame Margarete, claims the right to demand that his successor marry her."
"Since Dame Margarete insists on her right, we have asked her to come here tonight so the candidate may have a look at her."
"Night has fallen already.
Will you do me the honor to accompany me to the parsonage?"
Sofren had heard that Dame Margarete might be a witch.
But he did not feel it would do him any harm just to enter the house.
"My lot is not an easy one.
This the fourth time I must be handed over like a piece of furniture to whomever claims me..."
"But I am attached to this place, to every chair and candlestick..."
"...and if you part with what has become so important to your life, your innermost heart gets torn open.
And you die..."
"You are not engaged to any young maiden, are you?"
"I hope that you will accept my hospitality.
It is dark and long way to the Inn."
The next morning, Sofren woke up late.
Never in his life had he been so well dressed!
He wore a black coat and breeches that had been put beside his bed.
"I had the most wonderful sleep last night.
I felt I was resting in Abraham's bosom."
"Indeed... there I have never slept."
In front of him lay a gleaming white herring.
He was drawn to it as if by a magic power.
Dame Margarete's two old servants had been with her as long as anyone could remember.
After Sofren had eaten the fat herring and emptied the bottle of schnapps, he felt very strange.
As if in a fog, he saw Dame Margarete, not old and ugly, but as a young smiling girl.
"Dame Margarete, I love you!
Let me stay here with you always."
"Isn't it so, Master Sofren, that you offered me your heart and hand and asked me to be your wife?"
"Of course you will have your freedom.
You have your room and I have mine.
I only wish to stay and manage everything as before."
"Sofren, how could you!"
"How did the widow bewitch you?"
"With a herring she gave me."
"It made me so dizzy that I proposed to her."
"I cannot get you if I do not get the post, and I will not get that unless I wed the old woman."
"But after she dies, I inherit everything.
Then we can marry."
"Can Dame Margarete really not see who it is?
"Why, it is my sister Mari."
"She is so unhappy at having to leave me!
I beg you to let Mari live at the parsonage in return for help around the house."
"Do you think the old woman will be done for soon?"
A few weeks later, a neighboring parson joined the two in wedlock.
Even though both bride and bridegroom preferred a quiet ceremony, it was the custom in the area to hold a big celebration.
"We will now drink to the health of the bridal couple and wish them a long and happy life."
The day after the wedding. Sofren made up for it.
"In the future. I suggest you and your companions be less high and mighty.
For I am master of this house."
"Master Sofren is too big for his boots.
Give him a drubbing!"
"I suggest you concentrate on prayers and sermons.
Do not play master here.
I am master of this house!"
Time passed by...
Dame Margarete had not yet died and Sofren had not been able to see Mari alone.
It was not the only time that Sofren was unlucky.
"Oh!
The Parson cast amorous glances at me!"
"Let the fine fellow go!"
"I will have you know I am a decent girl!"
Sofren was at his wit's end.
Finally he stooped to courting at night just as peasant lads did.
"I had a sudden stomachache and was just going to ask my sister for some drops."
"If you need drops, you had better come to me!"
Sofren would not give up.
A night or two later he tried again.
"My little popsy!"
"Shame, that you cannot leave us girls alone!"
One evening they sat together all three, working.
"Do you know what country folk say about you, Dame Margarete?
That you got your former husband through black magic!"
I also wonder a good deal about that herring you gave me --- was it real?
"No, it had a spell cast upon it!"
"And they say you have a potion which can prolong one's life."
"It must be the truth... just look at me.
I will live for at least another hundred years!"
A few nights later the full moon came shining into Dame Margarete's chamber.
"Never have I seen the like.
The Devil himself walking in the pastor's slippers!"
A couple of hours went by but Dame Margarete held out bravely.
"So that is how the Devil looks!"
Sofren did one stupid trick after another.
However, one day something happened of the greatest importance to everybody.
"Shouldn't you prepare your Sunday sermon instead of idling here?"
Sofren hoped Dame Margarete would stay up in the loft and mayby in the meantime he could meet Mari.
But Mari was where Sofren least expected.
"Be careful, Dame Margarete!
The ladder is gone!"
"The thigh-bone is broken and she suffered a concussion.
But she will recover."
Several weeks passed before Sofren was allowed to enter the sickroom.
During this time, Sofren truly grew fond of Dame Margarete, who nursed little Mari day and night as tenderly as a mother.
"I am reminded of my youth..."
"My first husband and I were engaged for many years when he applied for the post here and learned he could have it only if he wedded the parson's widow."
"We knew that the widow was weak and could scarcely live long.
It was a sore temptation to us..."
"Yes, God forgive us.
We built our happiness on the hope of another's death."
"Five years we had to wait.
But these rooms hold memories of thirty happy years, and in the churchyard is a grave that is never out of my thoughts."
"Forgive us, Dame Margarete!"
"Mari and I are not sister and brother --- she is my fiancee.
We have also waited for your death, Dame Margarete!"
"Poor children!
Poor children!"
Not long afterwards, Mari was on her feet again --- thanks to Dame Margarete's tender care.
But Dame Margarete now spent half the day in the churchyard by her first husband's grave.
One morning at breakfast, Dame Margarete was missing.
Do not forget, when my mortal remains are taken away, to put a horseshoe over the door and to strew linseed after me so that I shall not haunt you.
A week later the funeral took place.
"I render thanks for all the good I have known in my days."
My voice I raise by tones of bells In praise of the Lord of Lords.
To call God's folk to church And now to sound a burial hymn.
Following her own wish, Dame Margarete was buried with her first husband.
"We owe her a great debt, Mari. She taght you to keep a good home, and she taught me to be a honorable man."
THE DIAMOND SHIP Second Part of "The Spiders"
In the first part of The Spiders, millionaire adventurer Kay Hoog... thwarts the plan of the criminal Spiders organization... to steal the treasure of a lost Inca civilization...
Returning to America with Naela, a beautiful Priestess of the Incas...
He rejected the romantic advances of Lio Sha, one of the Spider's leaders... and proclaims his love for Naela.
Returning home from a false mission... he finds the dead body of Naela, murdered by the Spiders...
Kay Hoog swears that Lio Sha will pay dearly for her jealous act.
The house of steel.
Lio Sha.
"Our organization works like a machine...
It's not our fault that we still have not found the stone.
The Diamond Ship..."
"Again the lost stone is not there.
I will tell our clients about it this evening."
"And Kay Hoog?"
"Kay Hoog will not cross our path again He has already learned the power of the Spiders."
Kay Hoog.
"I have finally arranged a raid on the suspected house."
"But why are you concerned with this whole affair?"
"I have an old score to settle."
"The raid is set for exactly 11 o'clock."
"I'll be there with you."
A modern raid.
"3 1/2 Carats... $70,000 going once... going twice..."
The secret of the many diamond thefts.
The next day.
An old bookworm.
"This is new proof of my suspicions.
Under the Chinese quarter exists a secret Chinese city.
This piece of ivory is the entrance key."
"Search for this sign in the shops of the Chinese quarter there you will find the way to the subterranean city."
"But beware.
The Police will give you no protection in the Chinese quarter let alone in the subterranean city.
Remember - they deny it even exists!"
In the subterranean Chinese city.
"I must talk with the Captain of the Storm Bird as soom as possible Our search here for the Buddha-head diamond was in vain."
In one of the Chinese shops above the subterranean city.
"The Guards of Chinatown."
The gambling rooms of the Red Dragon.
"The Buddha-head diamond is not in the city otherwise we would have found it."
"The diamonds were of no value ti us.
Part of the proceeds from their sale was deposited in a joint account, and part..."
"I'll stay another two days until the initial excitement in over Then in the evening I was board the Storm Bird and we can sail immediately."
"Kay Hoog is here."
"Release the woman and you are free to go."
But they were not to be trusted As soon as Kay Hoog released her, he was overpowered and imprisoned.
Two days later...
"Will you make a deal?"
"How much?
Attorney Baker has little respect for the law.
"I heard that the Storm Bird is sailing for South America.
Is that true?"
"I have a case of secret documents that must be delivered to a foreign power outside of the United States.
The authorities must not learn of it."
"My client will pay $10,000 now and $20,000 upon delivery of the unopened case."
That evening.
An episode in India.
"The Diamond Ship has not fulfilled its mission The Buddha-head diamond has not been found."
"The Master will make a new attempt today to find the stone.
Yoghi All-hab-mah India's most famous clairvoyant will help in this holy cause."
A hypnotic-telepathic experiment.
"Find the Buddha stone, so that Asia can become great and free itself from foreign rule."
A heart attack.
Experiment successful.
In hypnotic trance, Yoghi saw stone in possession of Diamond magnate Terry London whose ancestors stole the holy stone generations ago Four-Finger John will make all preparations.
Dear Mr. Hoog:
Here are the decoded contents of the secret document About four hundred years ago, the Ming dynasty in China has in possession a diamond, which because of its peculiar shape resembled the head of Buddha.
This stone was stolen and, so the story goes, Asia will free itself from foreign tyranny when a Princess brings this stone back to Asia.
"Change course...
head for England!"
John Terry, the diamond magnate, and his daughter Ellen.
"I must leave at once on important business."
Mr. Terry returns.
The Spiders have kidnapped your daughter.
As ransom we demand the Buddha-head diamond.
You will hear from us.
The next day.
EXTRA!
SPECIAL EDITION!
5,000 POUNDS REWARD!
"The Storm Bird left the harbor tonight for an unknown destination."
On board of Storm Bird.
"I don't know what diamond you're talking about."
"It seems that the solution can only be found through John Terry himself."
The Spiders have kidnapped your daughter.
As ransom we demand the Buddha-head diamond.
You will hear from us.
"I don't know what they want from me.
I have never owned such a stone."
"And yet the secret must lie with you.
The Spiders do nothing that isn't thought out.
Isn't anything known in your family about such a diamond?"
"Perhaps one of your ancestors?"
"That's the founder of our family fortune one of the most famous pirate captains of the sixteenth century."
"The logbook of the Sea Witch."
"I vaguely remember reading something in the Captain's logbook that might have been a reference to the diamond shaped like a Buddha."
We went ashore on the coast of the Falkland Islands and found our secret cache in the caves, as we had left it two years ago.
"A few pages in the logbook are missing here.
What happened after distributing the loot I don't know.
Something terrible must have happened, because the logbook says only..."
I was the only one who could save himself.
"What happened... what catastrophe befell the unlucky sailors there is nothing in the logbook.
Shortly thereafter, the Captain died in a battle, and his successor brought the logbook and the picture to the family."
Many have tried to discover the secret of the hiding place but no one has succeeded.
"An old map of the Falkland Islands."
"Four-Finger John!"
"Let's see if we can find any clues in his room to the whereabouts of Ellen."
"If you tell us exactly what has happened to Ellen Terry, we will release you and give you the reward.
"Ellen Terry was taken on board the Storm Bird and is sailed immediately.
I don't know its destination."
"We will keep you here for 48 hours, to prevent sabotage of our plans Then you are free."
"I will try to find the stone...
the fate of your daughter depends on it I will succeed or perish."
"Stone possibly on Falkland Islands Kay Hoog on his way to find the diamond."
"Change the course of the Storm Bird at once!"
"I will force Ellen Terry under my will and make her the Princess who will free Asia from all foreign tyranny."
"When she wears the Imperial Crown, all Asia will lie at our feet."
"A footprint!"
The treasure cavern.
"Give me the Buddha-head diamond!"
"He has to have the stone.
I saw it in his hand."
"Hunger and thirst will make you talk."
The poisonous crater.
During the night, deadly fumes rose from the crater.
Weeks later, back in London.
"I was the only one who could save himself, and here is the stone."
"Shortly before you arrived, I received a call from the Pinkerton Detective Agency. They think they have found a clue to my daughter.
"An elderly gentlemen has registered at the Royal Hotel with a young woman Although she is supposedly his daughter, she fits the photo of the missing girl."
"I have been instructed to ask you to come along and identify the girl."
"We must be careful not to arouse suspicion You can observe their room from here."
"Lio Sha is dead."
"The stone is lost forever."
"No one must know.
For some time I have been followed by Indian spies The Asian Committee suspects me of being a double agent since I haven't been able to produce the stone as I had promised."

subtitles:
"Dangers of the fly" was rendered from a 35 mm copy, very well preserved by the "Pablo Ducrós Hicken" Film Museum.
During the process, a likely correct speed for projection was estimated.
DANGERS OF THE FLY
The aim of this film is to disseminate to the audience a knowledge that generally remains restricted to researchers.
The magnification diameters given in this film refer to the size of the image as projected on an 8 meters screen.
The fly, dipterous, grows in filth, lives among men and is the carrier of many diseases.
These insects have been and continue to be the object of countless scientific studies carried out by zoologists, entomologists and hygienists.
These dipterous are studied in medical zoology and parasitology research laboratories from a systematic point of view
(placing these insects in the zoological system ).
For a systematic study, zoologists begin by differentiating species within the same class
(In this case Brachycera ).
Their biology ( characteristics and habits), and their role as carrier and transmitter of pathogenic germs.
Fly legs are made of hair, claws, bristles, spines and flakes that work as an outstanding conveyor of germs, microorganisms and diseases.
By observing the wing veins, different types of Brachycera can be classified:
MUSCIDAE, TABANIDAE, CESTRIADE, ASILIDAE, etc.
The proboscis, an organ for grasping and sucking the food that this insect finds in rubbish, gets loaded with germs that can immediately be placed on man's food, skin and wounds.
(Enlargement: 3850 diametres)
In order to be studied, and without losing hair, flakes, bristles and other features that allow them to be identified, they are kepts in special jars.
They are put to death using Xylol, Chloroform, Benzine and Ether gasses, etc.
Afterwards, they are fastened with silver, gold or other stainless metals pins and are kept in special packing jars.
Flies are classified by their Proboscis, either inermis or pointed, depending on whether they can lacerate human and animal skin.
CHRYSOMIA MACELLARIA
Vulgar name:
SCREWWORM FLY
MUSCA DOMESTICA
Vulgar name:
HOUSE FLY
There are countless different kinds and species of inermis flies. Given their similar biology, they are profanely named flies..
SARCOPHAGA CARNARIA
Vulgar name:
FLESH FLY
Given that the fly legs are an excellent microorganism conveyor... If a solid growth media is melted in a sterile, germ free capsule  once it is cold, a fly is laid over it  and it walks along that sanitized surface   each step leaves a footprint...
... because the feet were in touch with filth and loaded with it, they leave germs with every step.
If that capsule is placed in an oven at 37º centigrade temperature  each microorganism reproduces until forming a colony of millions of bacteria.
24 hours later, the capsules impregnated by the flies  show that a bacteria colony has grown around each footprint.
If these colonies are touched using a previously sterilized platinum applicator  and a sample is spread over a sterilized glass  observing it through a microscope so we can see ... a tiny drop of culture fluid
contains millions of moving bacteria, the cause of several diseases.
(Enlargement: 35.000 diameters)
Dissecting a fly  shows that some of the bacteria and protozoan ingested by the insect are destroyed, while others resist digestion and thus reproduce.
Located in the dipterous excrements, these germs can affect people and cause diseases.
The events observed in the laboratory are identical to those that take place in nature.
The fly rubs its head and feet while eating from the same food that human beings will eat later the wings  and other parts  getting rid of the germs that they are loaded with.
Through different procedures  the fly leaves germs in all sorts of substances, like milk, stock, meat, etc, all of which constitute an excellent growth medium where germs can reproduce into millions within a few hours.
Through these habits, flies transmit:
TYPHOID FEVER, DYSENTERY,
CHOLERA, AND OTHER SEVERE INFECTIONS.
(The proboscis is covered with hair, which is an excellent microorganism transmitter)
The fly, a germ carrier, can alter the properties of milk that will later be ingested by children, causing food poisoning, disease, and the death of thousands of infants.
The death rate caused by intestinal diseases among the infantile population (0 to 3 years) reached 8500. This indicates how dangerous they are.
The following process has been described as the major cause of
Poliomyelitis or  Infantile paralysis... disease that kills 8900 of sick children in period of days  those who survive are crippled or paralyzed for life.
This disease, like brain and spinal cord meningitis, tuberculous meningitis and meningeal edema caused by intestinal intoxication are a statistical group called meningitis. Our hospital treats thousands of children affected by this disease.
After visiting places where excrements are disposed, the fly becomes a carrier of intestinal Vermes eggs (worms) through the same procedure described earlier. Minuscule Cestoda larvae pierce the skin, reach the intestine and cause severe anemia.
Enlargement: 100 diameters
Different protozoan like Balantidiun coli and Entamoeba dysenteriae cause acute dysentery.
Enlargement: 7000 diameters
The hematophagous fly uses its proboscis to pierce the skin and suck blood.
STOMOXYS CALCITRANS
Vulgar name:
STABLE FLY
TABANUS MEXICANUS
Vulgar name:
HORSE FLY
PANGONIA SP.?
Some of these species transmit trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping disease or "mal de caderas".
When men or animals are stung by this type of fly, they develop a deadly disease in a period of 9 to 10 days.
Through the observation of a blood sample taken from a sick animal, naturally or artificially infected red corpuscles numerous moving protozoans live and thus reproduce in the animal's blood, causing anemia, paralysis.
Trypanosoma equinum... This is the parasite that causes mal de caderas disease...
Tripanosoma equinum: a genus of parasitic flagellate protozoa of the family Trypanosomatidae.
Enlargement: 350.000 diameters
MUSCA DOMESTICA, STOMOXIS CALCITRANS and other species develop in excrement.
They lay eggs in excrement, rotten meat and other organic decomposed substances, where larvae can feed on.
Laying eggs takes them approximately 30 minutes.
This egg laying insect uses its touch sensibility  to find a hidden, appropriate place to lay its eggs...
Enlargement: 2000 diameters
... a group of 280 to 300 eggs are laid at the same time.
If these eggs were placed one next to the other, they would cover a 712 square millimeters surface.
Using a microscope, one can see that the eggs show a longitudinal line, where they hatch.
Depending on the temperature conditions, hatching occurs 12 to 24 hours after the eggs are laid.
Enlargement: 3150 diameters
This process occurs in less than a minute. ... the new born larvae leave the egg shells.
The larvae are viscous and transparent. They develop in a period of 8 to 14 days, depending on the temperature conditions and food availability.
The larvae turn into 8 to 10 millimeter long, opaque white worms.
Once the larvae are completely developed they stop eating and moving The metamorphosis begins... The larva turns into a pupa in 1 to 2 hours.
When the pupa is totally still, its outer shell gets thick and hard. Its color turns from white to brown. This process takes approximately 6 hours.
The fly can hibernate in excrement until the following season. When the new season begins, the pupa breaks and a perfect insect is born.
The size of a fly does not vary along its life. When it is born, its color is clear. Its wings are stuck to its sides.
If a fly lays approximately 300 eggs, and only half of them complet the process as described earlier, the following summer there will be:
1stOctober: 1 fly 1st November: 150 flies.
if this amount lays eggs during this period 22.934.144.295.301 flies.
If you kill a fly, you are killing 22 TRILLION dangerous insects.
There are countless procedures to exterminate flies.
The most successful and the one with best results in practice, is to create a hostile environment for this dipterous.
Demonstration:
A capsule containing excrements (Nº1) and another capsule containing excrements and lime at 1000 (Nº2 ) are exposed to flies.
8 to 10 days later, there is a large amount of larvae in the first capsule (Nº1)  while no larvae has grown in the second capsule ( nº2 ).
Every means at our disposal to exterminate flies are useful.
Insecticide is as deadly to flies as machine guns are to men.
A mix of: Milk 100 grams, Sugar 1 tablespoon, Formol 1 tablespoon This is an effective fly-killing candy.
Fly paper  and different traps.
All of these devices are highly effective.
THE END
HARD LUCK was made in 1921 and it has been lost for over sixty years.
It ended with a gag which Keaton said produced the greatest laugh of anything he ever did.
Rejected by his girl, he takes a high dive into a pool.
He misses the pool and leaves a hole.
Title: "Years later" and Buster emerges from the crater with Chinese wife and children.
Alas, most of this gag is missing and may never be found.
Only a still remains.
Otherwise, enough has been found to create an impression of the whole film.
Only about three minutes are missing.
Fired from his job, jilted by his girl, down on his luck only one thing left to do.
Lowering a safe... a fitting end.
Night falls... he wants to do the same.

A tale told in living pictures under the direction of Victor Sjöström
At the camera: J. Julius
Once there was a poor Salvation Army sister at death's door.
She was stricken with galloping consumption, and she had only held out for the space of a year.
When there was no hope left she had gone home to her mother.
Waiting at the foot of her bed was another Salvation Army sister who had once worked alongside the sick girl.
"Don't fret over those poor souls now, Sister Edit."
"You have done enough for them."
"Send for David Holm!"
"Please don't!
My daughter was yours as long as she had a spark of life."
"Let me have her to myself now that she is dying."
"Slster Maria, why don't you do as I ask?
Send for David Holm!"
"l shall go fetch him at once."
"You can't be serious, asking David Holm to attend a death bed?"
"l haven't been able to find him, but Gustavsson is looking too."
"He will bring him here if that is at all possible."
"Poor Mrs Holm Poor Mrs Holm"
"l'll take her back home."
"lt wouldn't do for her husband to see her should he come."
The evening on which these events took place was not an ordinary one.
It was New Year's Eve.
"Well, we will certainly know when it's time to toast the New Year!"
"lt's a spooky place to await midnight, here among the dead."
"You gentlemen are not afraid of ghosts, I hope?"
"Then I'd like to tell you a story while we wait for the midnight hour."
"l once had a pal called Georges, who was generally a jolly fellow."
"He came of a good family, and had studied hard at Uppsala University, so he knew a bit more than the rest of us."
"But a change would come over him on New Year's Eve."
"Remember that it's New Year's Eve, the last day of the year!"
"Whoever dies on this eve must drive the cart of death."
"There is an old, old cart..."
no ordinary driver holds the reigns."
"He is in the service of a strict master named Death."
"For him, a single night is as long as 100 years on Earth."
"Night and day he must carry out his master's business."
End of Part l
The Phantom Carriage Part ll
"Wherever he goes, he is greeted with sorrow and despair."
"There is no escape He must perform his sorry duty."
"Although the horse and cart remain the same, the driver will vary."
"The last soul to die each year, the one who gives up the ghost at the stroke of midnight, is destined to be Death's driver during the coming year."
"Now you know why i'm afraid of something fatal happening on New Year's Eve."
"And the odd thing is, you see, that Georges apparently died last New Year's Eve."
"Why hasn't Gustavsson arrived with David Holm?"
"Come with me, David Holm"
"Sister Edit is dying and she has asked for you."
"lf Sister Edit wants to see you, you must go at once!"
"David, I can't believe it's you!
You are meant to relieve me!"
"You ought to lift me up ln your cart and take me to the hospital."
"No living soul rides ln this cart."
"By the time I arrive it is too late for a doctor."
"You know well enough that I am no longer alive."
"But, worst of all, you must face the consequences of the evil you have wrought during your lifetime."
"David, do you think i'm unaware that it is my fault you have met such an end?"
"lf you hadn't fallen in with me you would have led a good life with your wife, children and brother."
"By tomorrow you will have served your time for drunken behaviour."
"But before you leave, a harsher punishment awaits you."
"Behold, your brother."
"While you were here he killed a man while intoxicated, and now a long prison term awaits."
"But we feel that you ought to serve the sentence instead, since you and you alone led him astray, and made him a killer."
"Does this not make you turn from your wicked ways, David Holm?"
"Yes, for only now do I realise how it feels to have brought great misery upon a loved one."
"What about your wife and children?"
"l know how miserable they felt, but I will turn over a new leaf."
End of Part ll
The Phantom Carriage Part lll
"No, she is not ill."
"She was well enough the other day, when she left."
"And here I was thinking I would come home to her with such joy!"
"lf she had gone openly,
I would have understood, but to slink off like that, to let me come home to an empty house, that was heartless!"
"l'll wipe those smiles off your faces."
"l'll find her, and I'll teach her how it feels when your heart freezes to its very core, like mine has!"
"l'll refrain from reminding you of your search for your wife, during which your feelings of hatred and revenge waxed stronger."
"l will take you to a time a year ago, to last New Year's Eve, when you came here, bringing such misfortune in your wake."
"A Salvation Army station had been set up here in town."
"And it was ready for use on New Year's Eve."
"Keep your food! I only want to sleep."
"Leave it be! It may be full of germs!"
"We don't have the sterilising oven going yet."
"Don't you realise, Maria, how it pleases me to help the first guest God sent us?"
"Please, go to bed. lt's been a busy day."
"Let me attend to this."
"Dear Jesus, let our first guest be blessed with a happy year."
All night long she bent over the coat, never giving thought to the germs she had inhaled."
"By the time she went to bed the chill of winter had thoroughly penetrated the room."
"Did you mend my coat?"
"Would you mind fetching the person who did this?"
"lt's a shame you went to all that trouble, Miss, but i'm used to having it like this."
"Before you leave, I'd like to ask you to visit me next New Year's Eve."
"You see, I prayed that our first guest would have a good year."
"And I wanted to find out if my prayers were answered."
"Oh, I'll be here."
"l'll come to show you God didn't give a fig for you or your twaddle."
"The time has come to honour that promise before you take over here."
"From you she contracted the disease that ends her life, and now she awaits your visit."
"You have possessed all that is most wonderful, but you have lost it!"
"You cannot avoid the torment or remorse, just as you cannot escape taking over as Death's driver for a year."
"Captive, take leave of thy prison!"
"Ye spirit that left thy body at the stroke of midnight, thou wilt relieve me of my office."
"For a year thou wilt reap souls."

"lt is Death, but too soon."
"You see that i'm not afraid of you."
"l will gladly heed your summons, but grant me a day's grace, for there is someone I must talk sense into."
"You do not know what terrible misfortune I have caused."
"l cannot approach the Lord before I have put it right."
"l must tell you that the person i'm waiting for is the man I love.
"Do you understand? The man I love!"
"l would grant you grace if it would avail you, but you have no power over this man."
"You have tried to make him mend his ways, believing he was good, but your hopes have been dashed time and time again."
"You're the one who enticed him away from his home and his work!"
"You made him the drunkard he is!"
"Don't let yourself be dragged under!"

"Run along and be saved, and upon my soul i'll come and watch you!"
"What's the use of making such a fuss?"
"l'm a consumptive, but I cough into people's faces in the hope of finishing them off."
"Why should they be better than us?"
"He's merely amusing himself.
He's not as wicked as he pretends to be."
"How can you be filled with such bitter hatred for your fellow man?"
"You needn't worry about that.
I'll be leaving town in a few days."
"No, you mustn't do that!"
"l would rather you stayed so I may challenge you again."
"However tempting that maybe, I still can't stay."
"You see, little missy, i'm on a journey throughout Sweden, in search of a person I must find at all costs."
"Who ls this person you seek?"
"You'll know that when I find the person in question"
"l am the one David Holm is looking for."
"l am his wife."
"l couldn't endure the life he led."
"I deserted him, took my children and crept away in secret."
"l moved to this town for it was so far from our old home, that I never expected him to come looking for me here."
"You must take him back!
It's his only hope!"
"l didn't mean that you must make up your mind on the spot, but promise me to listen to your heart, and we can talk again."
She had got the better of herself and asked for none of the things that belonged to this world.
"Just come with me!

She wanted to replant the seed that had fallen among the thorns, and she may well have gained her end had it not been that...
"The doctor says it's pneumonia."
"Her resistance is so poor for she has had ill health ever since last New Year's Eve."
"Yes, this David Holm has been her undoing."
"She worries so about the situation between him and his wife, but she mustn't know the truth."
"You might at least have the heart to spare the children from infection!"
"lt wasn't as easy to run away this time!"
"Haven't you had enough revenge?"
"lf only I hadn't brought them together again!"
"His sin would be of less magnitude if not for me."
"You must grant me grace!
I cannot die yet!"
"l must see him turn over a new leaf!
. Just spare me a few minutes!"
"You know I love him.
I've never loved him as I do today."
"Captive, ye of loving heart, take leave of thy prison."
"Come along.
There ls nothing for us to do here."
"Those who are to receive her will arrive shortly."
"You know, David, if I could send a message to humankind,
"l would like to send them a New Year's greeting."
"l would like them to dwell on a single New Year's prayer."
"Lord, please let my soul come to maturity before it is reaped."
"Why are we here?
Surely no one here is going to die!"
"No, I can't go on. I can't go on!"
"l'm sorry, but I must go away, and I cannot leave them behind."
"Please don't be angry with me.
It's not my fault."
"This will do, David.
It will suffice for the children and myself."
"Yes, David, I see what's coming."
"l'm obliged to watch.
I do not shirk my duty."
"You mustn't let it happen!
Thls mustn't come to pass!"
"Don't let those poor, innocent creatures die!"
"l have no power over the living."
"Where shall I turn?"
"Should I pray to God or to Jesus?
Who can tell me where to direct my plea?"
"l'm a poor, miserable sinner, I beseech thee Lord of life and Death!"
"l'm not worthy, I've broken your every commandment."
"Sentence me to eternal night!"
"Let nothing remain of me!"
"Do what you like to me, my Lord, only spare the three of them!"
"David, I see that I no longer need to grieve for you!"
"She hasn't done it yet.
I made it here in time!"
"Sister Edit is dead, and I have been at her side."
"l promised her to become a good husband and father."
"You're lying!

DESTINY: A GERMAN FOLK SONG IN SIX VERSES
Written and Directed by Fritz Lang
THE CHARACTERS AND PLAYERS
Somewhere, someday.
THE CREW
Authentic Oriental and Chinese artifacts and costumes provided by the Heinrich Umlauff Museum, Hamburg.
Praise the Lord!
FIRST VERSE
Lost in a valley, as if in a dream, there lay a little town to which two youths, drunk with love and filled with life, were drawn.
But as the golden leaves fell from the trees like tears thickly in sunset's glow, there at the crossroads, where so much had passed, stood Death, awaiting them in silence.
A town lost to memory...
Every evening, the local dignitaries gathered at the "Golden Unicorn" Inn for their nightcap.
His Importance, the Mayor.
His Reverence, the Vicar.
His Learnedness, the physician.
His Measuredness, the notary.
And the new schoolmaster.
Every evening, the wise, antique figurine of the lamp would hear the news of important goings-on in town.
But lately the honorable dignitaries had but one topic of conversation.
The stranger.
Again and again, nothing but the stranger.
One day the gravedigger was approached by a stranger, who asked the way to town.
He seemed strangely familiar to him although he had never come face-to-face with him before.
Who owns the land adjoining the graveyard?
The town magistrate has reserved it for the cemetery extension.
I think it unlikely that the magistrate would be willing to let you have the future cemetery land.
Why the devil are you so set on having it?
I am a wanderer who is very weary. I wish to plant a garden there.
Next to the cemetery?
In the council meeting, there was heated debate over the stranger's request, but the gold the stranger offered proved too tempting.
The stranger's offer was unanimously accepted and the cemetery annex was leased to him for 99 years.
But joy at the town's bulging coffers did not remain unclouded, for the stranger erected a wall around his land as invincible as the barrier his ways had created between himself and others.
See for yourselves, gentlemen!
I have walked all around the wall but found neither door nor gate!
Men, your efforts are in vain!
Only I know the gate that opens this wall!
And to this day no one has found a door in the eerie wall?
It is a time-honored tradition that young couples take their first drink at the "Unicorn"
from our bridal cup. One can see right on your faces that you are sweethearts!
Excuse me, could you tell me where my fiancé has gone?
My dear child, your fiancé left with the stranger who was sitting at your table.
SECOND VERSE
She seeks her love both here and there and wanders every alley.
She has strayed beyond the town.
There in the moonlight, grave-by-grave, lies the old cemetery wall.
A cold stream of pale figures flows around her.
The bell tolls, the watchman cries.
Love wrestles with death and believes.
Hear my words, my good townsfolk.
The clock has just struck ten.
Take care lest too much wine you drink, and end in the Devil's realm.
There are herbs that draw mysterious powers from the magical light of the full moon.
David's harp and Solomon's seal, boxthorn and centaury.
No one knew this better than the old apothecary.
The old pharmacy has watched its owner since childhood days when he stuck his nose into his father's retorts and melting pots.
But today, for the first time ever, it found him together with a young girl.
Poor child, you're trembling with fever.
Just wait, I'll brew you a strong tea. That will make you feel better.
THE SONG OF SOLOMON
Set me as a seal upon thine heart, As a seal upon thine arm.
For love is strong as death, Passion is cruel as the grave.
It blazes up like blazing fire, Fiercer than any flame.
For love is as strong as death.
Hear my words, my good townsfolk.
The clock has struck eleven!
What, my child, do you seek in my realm?
I did not summon you.
I want to go where my beloved is.
Where is he whom you stole from me?
I did not steal him.
His time was merely up.
What you see here are the lives of men, they flare up and burn for a time.
But then they are extinguished at the hour the Lord decides.
Believe me, my task is heavy.
It is a curse.
I am weary of witnessing the suffering of men and earning their hatred for obeying the Lord.
O Death, is there no way to awaken to new life a light that's been extinguished?
Is there no way to overcome you?
I do believe: Love is stronger than death!
Is your love stronger than death?
Do you wish to fight he who is eternal?
I would bless you if you should conquer me.
See here three lights about to flicker out.
I place it in your hands to spare them.
If you should succeed, even though it be just one, I will grant to you your beloved's life.

CHARACTERS IN "THE FIRST LIGHT"
THE STORY OF THE FIRST LIGHT
The city of believers.
Come, believers, come to pray!
Ramadan.
Allah, Allah il Allah Muhammad rassul Allah!
Zobeide, the Caliph's sister.
The Frank.
There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his prophet!
Are you crazy? Do you wish to destroy us both?
I haven't seen you since Ramadan began.
Night after night I await the messenger who will summon me into your arms again.
But all in vain.
Tonight I will send you Ayesha.
But now, I beg you, leave this holy place or you are lost!
A Frank!
An infidel!
A giaour!
A giaour has desecrated this holy site!
Back!
Do not defile this holy ground with the blood of an infidel!
The Caliph.
Zobeide?
My sister?
We do not know where the Frank abides, but heed my advice, Caliph.
What do I care for the fate of a giaour?
I merely wanted to spare this holy place from being defiled by his blood.
Then you will be glad to hear that the desecrator shall not escape punishment.
We are on his trail and I have placed a ring of guards around the city. His every attempt to flee will only drive him into my hands all the faster.
You must go to him, Ayesha!
You must bring him to me by the secret path!
Only here will he be safe.
In the very palace of the pursuer they will not seek the pursued.
El Mot, the gardener.
Come when darkness falls by the secret path!
My mistress will hide you in the palace until the anger of the mob has subsided.
Surround the palace of Princess Zobeide!
Let anyone in, but no one out!
That night.
Come with me so I can hide you until the henchmen's watchfulness wanes.
The Caliph!
What was that?
They're probably hunting down a mangy dog.
Your command has been fulfilled, Master!
The night is beautiful, my sister.
I desire to spend it on the palace roof.
Will you join me?
Who is digging in our garden so late at night?
El Mot, the gardener. He wants to surprise you.
FOURTH VERSE
CHARACTERS OF "THE SECOND LIGHT"
THE STORY OF THE SECOND LIGHT
Carnival.
Monna Fiametta.
Giovanfrancesco.
Girolamo.
I'm pleased to see a smile on your face for once, my beautiful betrothed.
How near to death men often are without suspecting at all.
They believe an eternity remains to them, yet they do not even outlive the rose with which they trifle.
The Council of Fourteen deems Messer Giovanfrancesco politically all too suspicious.
It's unlikely he'll live to see the dawn.
It's not in vain that I'm the best swordsman on the Council of Fourteen.
For when Carnival heats the blood, it is easy to be drawn into quarrels that often prove deadly.
I know you hate me, Monna Fiametta.
And up until the hour of our wedding, which now you curse in vain, you are free to do so.
But I hope you spare a smile for me then as well, and a rose, as you did for another, who will long be rotting in his grave.
Cockfight.
Letters.
Take this letter to Messer Girolamo.
Tell him I send it with my most beautiful smile.
Take this letter to Messer Giovanfrancesco as quickly as you can.
But in secret.
No one must know. Especially not Messer Girolamo!
Summon the Moor!
I, Monna Fiametta, bid you to be my guest this evening.
I believe we have much to say to one another.
Come when the clock strikes ten. My nurse will guide you.
Madonna Fiametta sends you this letter with her most beautiful smile.
Do you perhaps have a second letter to deliver?
I have an enemy, Moor, who I have invited here tonight.
He must not leave this house alive.
Do you understand?
Dearest, flee!
The Council of Fourteen wishes you dead, and Girolamo is to be your executioner.
Avoid any quarrel!
Flee without delay and do not return home until I call you.
The fate he intends for you shall be meted out to Girolamo himself tonight!
I kiss your eyes and heart!
Fiametta.
I will lure him with the tip of my sword to where you stand.
And when he turns his back to you...
Madonna Fiametta sends you this.
And this letter...
I, Monna Fiametta, bid you to be my guest tonight.
I believe we have much to say to one another.
Come when the clock strikes ten. My nurse will guide you.
...and good advice!
Not a word, not a whisper, if you value your life and Monna Fiametta's honor.
No matter what happens, remain silent.
The tenth hour.
Carnival!

CHARACTERS OF "THE THIRD LIGHT"
THE STORY OF THE THIRD LIGHT
The highly honorable Mr. A Hi, greatest magician in the Middle Kingdom, has just received a most disturbing letter.
O Venerable One!
O Millenarian!
O Beacon of Wisdom!
O Jewel!
Tomorrow is my birthday and I have commanded that there shall be great joy throughout the Middle Kingdom!
Upon my birthday, I wish that you, pearl of all magicians, dispel my imperial boredom with never-before-seen magic tricks from the treasure vaults of your illustrious spirit!
With kind regards, DJOU SCHUAN WANG, Emperor
PS:
Should, contrary to expectations, you bore me as well, O Venerable One, I shall be forced, with deep regret, to have you beheaded!
The Above.
Tiao Tsien!
Liang!
Would you be so kind as to bring me my Sunday wand, the one made of jade?
Whereupon the honorable Mr. A Hi freed himself from the cause of his vexation.
We will go on a journey!
The Son of Heaven!
The Emperor's archer.
Son of Heaven, forgive the dirty toad that kisses the dust at your feet.
Mr. A Hi is away and not to be seen on any of the roads.
O Son of Heaven, forgive the miserable earthworm at your feet.
There is no sign of Mr. A Hi on any of the rivers.
A Hi!
Come then, let's see your magic!
Abracadabra, witch's fat, thrice black cats!
Venerable Son of Heaven!
To protect you from your enemies for all time, allow me to present you with a complete, well-organized army for your birthday.
Salute the venerable Son of Heaven.
Imagine what this will cost!
My dear A Hi, your gift is beautiful, but she who presents it is even more so.
I shall keep her as well.
O Son of Heaven, allow me to give you, instead of this little toad that is totally unworthy of you, a magic horse, unique the world over.
Dear Mr. A Hi, I am very pleased with you.
I shall keep the horse and the girl as well.
O Most Venerable One, that is impossible!
I cannot do without the girl when working magic!
Really?
You cannot? Let me show you how well you can! Either...
Or...
O Son of Heaven, your eloquence is irresistible.
Take him away to the highest pagoda!
Tomorrow morning he shall be beheaded!
You must make her submissive to me, A Hi. Otherwise... Well, you know!
You will help me, won't you?
Be sensible, Tiao Tsien!
What can poor Liang offer you?
But the Emperor...
Give back my wand!
You...
You miserable, ugly cactus!
The escape.
The pursuers.
We must continue on foot, Liang!
The path grows too narrow.
My jade piece from A Hi's magic wand grows smaller and smaller each time I make use of its powers.
Onward!
Onward!
They're at our heels!
Demons of fire, block their way with flames!
That night.
Take A Hi's magic horse and bring me those two, dead or alive!
The magic horse.
SIXTH VERSE
Undefeated, Death has won the battle, though he places a turn of fate within her reach.
Once again, he looks kindly on her distress.
"May the Lord mercifully let you win the life of your beloved!
May He gather you both to Him for your passion and suffering!"
Do you understand now, my child, why I grow so tired and weary of my task?
I am the eternally invincible.
Go back among the living, and live!
Grant me the life of my beloved!
There is one final way!
Within the span of one earthly hour bring me another life, one that has not yet expired, one for whom years, days and hours lie ahead.
Then I will return to you the life of your beloved.
The clock has struck eleven!
Take care with fire and the light so that none shall come to harm!
Praise the Lord!
Death has taken my beloved from me.
I wanted to follow him.
Old man, you have enjoyed life so long.
What more can it offer you?
Give me your life.
Grant me the last few days you are still allotted.
Help me to save the life of my beloved.
Not a single day, not a single hour, not a single breath!
The beggar!
Beggar, do you seek an end to all of your suffering?
Give me your life!
Not a single day, not a single hour, not a single breath!
The infirmary.
The woman in childbed is well and the child is healthy.
But the young lad who was brought in this evening died shortly before ten.
Oh, my Lord, the poor boy! So young, yet he had to die.
For the likes of us, we'd be glad no longer to wake up in early morning. Death seems to have passed over us.
If you have grown so weary of your life, which of you will give me yours for compassion's sake?
That was the last one!
My child!
Another life, one that has not yet expired.
I was not able to overcome you for that price.
Now take my life as well! For without my beloved it is less than nothing to me!
I shall take you to the man you love.
He who gives up his life shall gain it!
Hear my words, my good townsfolk.
The clock has just struck twelve!
Take care against ghosts and apparitions! Let no foul spirit enchant your soul!

On a warm winter afternoon, the sun was rising.
Through the clouds, it was throwing its light on this ravine.
Taro is a small woodcutter favorite of his master.
Hey!
Go for Taro.
Hey Taro, your master is calling you.
Take this package to the station, before the next train out.
Then you can go home.
In a city street, there were people around the Yagibushi dancers.
Taro passed by and joined them.
Obstitane Butler.
I'll shoot him with the airgun.
Miss!
Miss!
The girl, opened a way through the crowd to the Yagibushi dancers.
The girl doesn't have any money.
Taro sympathizes and offers all his coins.
Here you are, Miss.
Let's go home together.
Mitsuko, ex-girlfriend of Koichiro, niece of the master.
Without money or food, and tired from the long trip to the rocks of the ravine.
Kojiro Sugino, who was expelled from the orchestra in the capital, had a rugged life, but now has changed.
He is returning home to his father, where he lived years ago.
Koichiro Sugino fainted while playing at the musical society
If you don't come home and apologise now, I will no longer regard you as my son.
Koichiro Sugino, panned by the public.
Yoko, a former famous singer married to Koichiro, is the only one who supports him.
Fumiko, Koichiro daughter.
Yoko, Fumiko, forgive and be patient.
When we get home everything will be easier.
Tsurukichi is a pitiful tramp a recently freed convict, who has nothing, but his feeling to be cast out of society, his poverty and hunger.
Kamezo,is a pitiful tramp a recently freed convict, who has nothing, but his feeling to be cast out of society, his poverty and hunger.
and also has tuberculosis .
The night keeps the sadness  and breaks the joy, as Christmas arrives.
Kamezo and Tsurukichi had to start walking after finishing their daily breakfast.
Today as ususal, the master has gone to work in the mountains.
In the villa they are installing Christmas ornaments.
See the Yagibishi dancers over there, ask them if they can come to our house tonight.
Can you perform at our house tonight?
- Yes, with pleasure
What!
I said give us something!
We have nothing.
We have not eaten for days
The girl is crying a lot.
They look really bad.
I propose to share our bread.
Crossroads of Destiny. two go to the right,three to the left.
I helped this little hare, wounded by a gunshot.
Unfortunately, it is not old enough to live without its parents.
Hey Taro.
Go home and look after the hare.
Finally they reach the mountain ridge, from where he can see his hometown.
This will be the last trip.
Ah...all what I see here is my home.
What you see is my home.
These wood, forest and mountains are our blessing.
Cheer up!
I'm sure my father can accomodate us.
I'll take this to my grandfather.
Dusk, when the wind blows in the treetops.
The master comes back home after finishing his day's work.
Koichiro has reached the door of his house thanks to the encouragement of his wife and daughter.
Do you work at this house?
can you tell me...
Is my father in?
The Master?
He will be back soon.
Mitsuko also?
Mitsuko's home.
I'll call her.
Mitsuko combing alone.
Ma'am, please come.
Someone's asking for you.
I'm combing now.
Wait for a while.
They reached a secluded villa.
Because they're so hungry and tired.
The need does not respect any laws.
A little Christmas tree!
I cannot cut it without tools.
I'll borrow some from the butler.
The old guard is wiping out the sweat, of a working day in the mountains.
Hey, if they find us, we will have to go to that dark place again!
Let us go away.
Why this look?
Are you going to drink, too?
No, thanks.
I will drink with my father.
Seems that your daughter has a fever.
What do you mean?
I do not see anyone.
Who's there?
Who's there!
Feed the dogs.
And if the storm comes, take them in.
Father I am Koichiro.
Taro, anything can happen today, the others and you should stay home.
Your hands are shaking.
I'll turn on the light.
No, I have not received help for 10 years.
I'll do it alone, without your help.
Bring me some wood.
If you do not stop, I'll shoot.
I ask a favor.
I want to be reborn.
Give joy to this family.
Father, our bodies have the same blood .
Do not you hear the sound of our blood?
Where was that blood for so long?
Exchange.
Now you shall strike.
Father, then, do you agree to let us stay tonight?
Father, I ask you a favor.
A man with his wife and daughter, with no place to sleep,
And nothing to eat...
We are begging you.
My head is going to explode.
You said you'd take the dogs inside.
My dogs are important.
You're not.
You're Late.
You're late.
What is special about today?
Koichiro, I think you will like this.
You idiot!
Take away the extra plates, Two plates is enough.
The guard is becoming merciful.
This is an important moment.
Hear.
The first verse is for you.
Embrace her, please, father.
Well, you see!
We will leave soon.
I do not own anything.
All that I have, are my wife and daughter.
Mitsuko, bring me a glass of that wine.
No, I can not.
I will prepare the beds.
Well, find Sugino and ask him to bring Taro to the Christmas party.
I would go, but I can not leave here tonight.
Thank you for coming.
Since I can not go, please take them with you instead.
Happiness.
A terrible snow storm, strikes with demonic rage.
Finally the father refuses to accomodate them.
They go out in the snowstorm, hungrier and more tired than when they arrived.
We can sleep here.
What is this sorry state?
Where you did you leave your art. Try to play it.
Idiot!
The Master was anxious and went to look for a woodcutter.
The young girl was missing Taro.
You can come home.
I will remain with you, even if I have to leave my daughter here on the floor.
If I leave, I have no another door open to me.
- And if you go through that the door I would close shortly thereafter.
Do not say anything more...
What would you do if I was a thief?
It is impossible to forgive you.
No father.
Please let me stay at home.
Say yes, please.
Stand up!
Otherwise I will throw the dog at you.
What do you say?
Throw the dog at me?
Leaving aside other things, a man of honor would not fight with someone like you.
Mitsuko has decided.
Go away with this.
Taro is worried and follows them secretely.
I have Prepared a room.
Okay.
Take the woman and the girl and ask the maids for help.
Ah, the sweet sound of old violin .
Please go away.
The daughter!
The daughter is already cold!
A new life.
If my servant had not been kind to them...
If the master had taken pity on him...
We have to be merciful with the whole mankind.
For example, Jesus was merciful and told us to do the same.

CASTLE VOGELÖD:
THE REVELATION OF A SECRET 5 Acts based on the story of the same name in the Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung by Rudolf Stratz.
adapted by Carl Mayer.
Direction:
F. W. Murnau.
1st Act.
For days now, a rained-out October Hunt at Castle Vogelöd.
The Lord of the Castle.
The guests.
Count Oetsch!
...You!
... Count Oetsch? !
You forgot to invite me? !
The retired provincial judge.
He's reputed to have shot his brother dead three years ago!
He thereby became sole heir...
The anxious gentleman.
Every single person who was able to follow the proceedings at the time is convinced he's the murderer!
Once more I stress I'm still expecting your brother's widow as a guest this evening...!
The murder victim's widow?
She got married again one year ago to Baron Safferstätt!
I should like to spare us all the experience of the Baroness encountering you here, Count!
So you're staying!
Then let it be on your head.
Awaiting the Baroness.
Any moment now she'll be showing up and inside is Count Oetsch...!
So you claim to have learnt the art of prophecy in India?
Would you care to reveal then, in light of this rain-drenched hunt, whether any of us will be able to get off a shot?
One shot will be fired...!
... ...Oetsch is inside! ...perhaps even... two? !
...
You'll understand that... under these circumstances... we cannot stay... at your side...!
No! You can't just leave!
Do you know who's coming here to see you?
Father Faramund from Rome!
Father... Faramund... from Rome...?
!
Yes!
In all the excitement I had almost forgotten!
I have to go and get his letter for you this instant.
Father...
Faramund...? !
Surely you don't mean to throw me out of your house?
She's staying!
She wants to wait for Father Faramund!
...that the wife of my so tragically deceased relative will be your guest fills me with great joy.
I bless the circumstance that leads me north again after my decades-long sojourn in Rome.
In the days ahead I will come to Vogelöd to finally see all of you, my dear friends, face to face...
End of the First Act.
2nd Act.
The next day - a surprise: sunshine!
...well, finally!
Weather forecast: Sunny today.
No precipitation.
Aren't you coming along on the hunt?
I only hunt in rain and gale.
Say, why is it your husband's always so quiet?
But, of course, after about a quarter of an hour...
Daytime.
His Reverence, Father Faramund has just reported he'll be arriving this evening.
That bizarre Oetsch is really going hunting in such beastly weather!
Of course he would know to stay out of the way of his kin, the Father!
...I will... have much... to discuss... with the Father... this evening...!
Evening.
If the Baroness wishes, I will be happy to see her this evening.
Now our house is blessed.
No matter what happens, think... kindly of me!
The Baroness bids His Reverence enter.
Speak... dear child... speak...!
How strange.. Reverend... this encounter.
...because all these years...
I've wrestled with my thoughts...!
...with you, Reverend.. as the only person, friend and kin to my deceased husband, that I can talk to...!
...It's now been 4 years...
End of the Second Act.
3rd Act.
Our marriage was... at first... like one continuous day of bliss.
And so we spent months in inebriated bliss.
One day he went off...
Weeks later he came back... he was a different person.
Buried himself in writings... holy books...
Believe me, dear child, true happiness lies only in the renunciation of all worldly things.
He turned into a saint... he only wanted to see a saint in me...
And for months it was like that...
I grew cold... the more pure he became, the more terrible I found my earthly bonds...!
I thirsted... to see evil... to desire evil...
Then I came to know Baron Safferstätt...
My husband wanted to give away his possessions, to divide up his fortune amongst the poor... terrible arguments erupted between him and his brother... one evening - there was an all-out row!
something horrible happened - my husband... was... shot.
I can't go on any further...
Not right now...
Tomorrow...
If you'll excuse me for the rest of the day,
I'll call upon the master of the manor tomorrow.
Tall tales of the hunt.
So you don't believe I got a lion once?
Night-time.
Ask the Reverend to see me.
Quarter of an hour later.
No! No-one left through here!
We've looked around the entire castle...!
It's getting downright eerie in here!
One hour later.
No trace of the Father can be found.
A crime? !
... Maybe it was... Count Oetsch?
Dreams.
That does it!
Tomorrow I'm getting out of here!
But meanwhile, the kitchen boy is also dreaming of the events of the last few hours...
End of the Third Act.
4th Act.
The morning of the third day.
Surely you understand!
Out of nowhere important business to attend to!
Is there anyone left who isn't frightened by my house.
I've notified the authorities!
Regarding my suspicion of this Count Oetsch...!
One happy man.
She's so strange...
says nothing.. nothing at all..
about the Father going missing...? !
Midday.
You once committed a murder? !
What... are you... trying to...
say by that...?
Gentlemen!
Why don't you just let me finish? !
That is what I dreamt this past night!
Count Oetsch!
It seems to me that the mood in my house at this moment is not suited to such jokes...!
Believe you me, my eye for spotting criminals is adept...!
...and I'm saying Count Oetsch is definitely connected to the disappearance of the Father.
He's putting on airs in order to conceal his latest crime.
He needs to apologise to you in front of all the guests for his inappropriate jokes!
You absolutely need to speak with him.
So you know something, Count!
Perhaps you have some idea of who people here suspect in the disappearance of the Father?
Me!
But I know even more, Herr Retired Provincial Judge.
I can also glean secrets.
For example, I'd now like to reveal to our Baron one of his secrets.
Count Oetsch.
If you know other peoples' secrets, you should not reveal them in front of everybody!
I shall honour your opinion!
I'd like to whisper only a very few words to Baron Safferstätt!
...No..
I.. am.. no... murderer...
Just what are these accusations?
Is it perhaps that you wish to accuse the Baron in the murder of your brother?
Perhaps?
I will consult Baron Safferstätt.
Today I'll reveal it!
He is the murderer of my husband...!
...In an argument, he shot his brother!
End of the Fourth Act.
5th Act.
Half an hour later.
What do you know about that time...
dear... speak! ...
The Count certainly made haste...!
And I tell you, he's also got the Father on his conscience!
Father Faramund... has returned!
Yesterday I wanted solace.
You didn't come! ... Today...
...Because you, as a priest, are obliged to remain silent!
We can do nothing right now!
The events of recent days probably will now become clear.
A few days before the murder of my husband Oh, I dread so much holiness!
...A... murder! ...
Baron Safferstätt, consumed by passion for me, had misunderstood me in a gruesome way! ...
He shot my husband...
Two days later he confessed to me.
Then I recognised my guilt as well!
The Count was arrested.
Had he been convicted we would have poisoned ourselves...
in order to prove his innocence...
But! He was not convicted!
We carried on!
Fearing life!
Fearing death.
Each of us cursed!
Bound through our guilt!
We got married!
That was our marriage!
...So we were two comrades!
And today I have redeemed him!
I have accused Count Oetsch of fratricide!
...That is how far fate has driven me!
Now you know everything! And you must remain silent!
..I... understand... you! ...
Act like a man!
...I... was... not... happy...
A... shot? !
Evening calm.
...he... is... dead! ...
I, the innocent outcast, always knew...
So every circumstance had to be aligned just so, in order for me to be finally set free from this degrading suspicion!
For that reason I forestalled the arrival of Father Faramund at the castle!
We have much to apologise to you for!
Evening.
I am Father Faramund from Rome.

Werner Krafft?
Hmm...
Do you know a William Krafft?
William Krafft is my brother!
He used to live in the City Hotel.
I haven't seen him in five years.
I had to leave Europe, while...
I'll be very happy to help William Krafft's brother.
The jewellery dealers.
For Florence.
You know what, Krafft? Your brother Werner was here.
I have lent him money, William, because... because I thought...
Tonight I need to get a ring, that looks just like this one!
That was Krafft.
To the City Hotel!
Mr. Yquem has had to close the office a little earlier today, Madam.
No, Madame, his Lordship is not back yet.
She is called Miss Florence Forster. She disappeared four years ago.
Her current whereabouts are not known.
The City Hotel
Florence Yquem
- Tiergartenstr. 245 My love; unfortunately I have to take a business trip, but I shall return tomorrow.
Kisses from your, Harry.
It's sad that the days pass so quickly, that I have to spend them away from you!
Margot, a friend of Florence.
Tonight I would like "dinner for two"
Turtle soup?
Fried oysters?
Pâté de fois gras en croûte...
With white Port Wine vintage 1864, Roast Beef with artichoke hearts, mushrooms, rémoulade sauce.
Plus, a very fiery Chambertin 1911... I do not want any dessert, but cheese... baked.
And Heidsieck champagne, "goût américain".
Florence Yquem
- Tiergartenstr. 245 My love; unfortunately I have to take a business trip, but I shall return tomorrow.
Kisses from your, Harry.
Mr. Krafft has just gone out.
Anyway, I need a room.
As you have no luggage, you will have to pay for the room in advance...
This will take you to old Upton.
In the meantime, you can wait here for Mr. Krafft.
You look great, my child.
But why do all this if your husband is always travelling?
Well, a beautiful woman, need not necessarily be true to her husband.
Mr Krafft left the hotel about an hour ago, but he has ordered dinner for two at 10pm.
I love my husband more than anything, Margot.
But before you got married, were you not in love with another man?
I remember there was much talk about it, but nobody knew exactly who he was.
Back then I loved my husband, but not as I love him today.
My heart belonged to another man.
And when my father gave me away to Harry against my will...
I must speak to Miss Florence again, at any cost!
It's useless to tell you the name of my future husband!
It would be pointless to go against the will of my father.
Let's go up and see if Florence has recovered from her migraine.
She is not alone!
And then? And then?
You have made me very curious about your story and I can't wait to hear how it continues!
Is Mr. Yquem at home?
Then you better tell his wife.
This is very interesting, really interesting!
And your husband never found out what was going on?
Charles Meunier - requests to be invited in for the lady's own good.
I don't understand you, Florence!
Why do you dismiss these visitors?
Just yesterday I met a gentleman at the City Hotel, and already today...
My dear lady: Would you do me the honour of dining with me today in the same restaurant for dinner, where we met yesterday?
I kiss the tips of your rosy fingers.
And your husband, Margot?
My husband...
My husband takes care of his business... Like yours!
What's wrong with you?
You look like a hunter, laying in wait...
You're right, and there is the target, that I'm waiting for.
I'll tell you, on the evening of my betrothal to Florence, something mysterious occurred...
Florence retired to her bedroom as she was suffering migraines; her father and I were worried about her condition, so we went up to her room.
Tell me the truth, Florence:
Do you love this man?
I can't believe that Florence has deceived me.
Although I can't get the memory of that evening out of my mind!
Go to Tiergartenstr. 245, the Yquem residence.
You'll only get it back when you use your own lips!
In the Bible it is written: "Let not thy left hand know what thy right is doing"
I must discover the truth, whatever the cost!
Let us not question your confidence in me, my beloved Harry, my heart and soul belong only to you!
I have never yearned for another, and I remain for now and forever- Your Florence.
I must be certain!
Bring me an envelope without letterhead.
I only have a penny and I beg you once again to give me a little ammount of money.
I don't know what else to do!
Please allow me a little longer as I'm waiting here for my brother.
I have just learned that you are back in town, and I beg you, I hope to see you this evening.
Always yours, Florence.
You can count on it, he will suffer for this, the scoundrel!
I have just learned that you are back in town, and I beg you, I hope to see you this evening.
Always yours, Florence.
I need a taxi in five minutes.
I am glad to see, my dear, that you have been enjoying yourself without me.
I will therefore no longer stand in the way of your pleasure...
How long is it from here to Tiergartenstr. 245?
You are making a big mistake, Mr. Yquem, if you continue to neglect your wife!
Consul, your Master is not coming.
We must be alone again!
For once and for all, the lady is not interested in seeing you.
That should be enough to change her mind!
Charles Meunier - If you continue to refuse to see me, then tomorrow the whole city will know about that mysterious incident on the day of your betrothal to your husband.
Show him in.
Do what you will. Destiny is in your hands.
You can reveal whatever you want to the world, but you will never persuade me to break the oath that I swore to my husband.
...Werner!
Please forgive me, but you look incredibly like an old friend...
So this letter then was also meant for my brother, Werner!
That is indeed my handwriting, but I never wrote such a letter!
Do you know anything about what happened to your brother?
Please, my lady, spare me the questions about my brother.
He will be lounging around somewhere in some far off country!
Dear William, I have returned, but misfortune has followed me.
The woman, who is the reason for my return, I am unable to find. The bearer of this letter, I owe money.
Please help me, otherwise you condemn me to a sad end.
Your brother, Werner.
I know where Yquem lives.
He has a very beautiful wife.
A Mr. Krafft is with the lady.
Prepare Madame's baggage.
She will leave the house this very night..
You've made a mistake, Mr. Yquem.
Locked!
My poor friend!
I knew all about this and have come ...to help you in your hour of need!
Women are all the same!
Forget them!
No, I will never forget Florence!
I have come, my lord, to warn you.
Your wife is in great danger!
Florence? !
Florence? !
Florence is here?
Your wife doesn't want to make up with you, because you have offended her honour.
She will leave this house under my protection.
Charles Meunier - If you continue to refuse to see me, then tomorrow the whole city will know about that mysterious incident on the day of your betrothal to your husband.
In fact, Mr. Superintendent.
As soon as I realized that my ring was swapped, I rushed here to report it. But...
As far as I know, there is only one person who could have committed this crime: The elegant Mister Krafft.
Mr. Krafft recently left in a car to Tiergartenstr. 245.
No officials in uniform!
All in civilian clothes!
That's my brother. But he never told me anything about all this.
Forgive me, Florence!
All of my life and work will be devoted to you!
My thoughts are only of you!
Florence, I know that I am not worthy of you, to ask such a question, but please show me pity:
What happened on the day of our betrothal?
I don't want the shadow of suspicion to be on you!
I'll take all the blame!
Where do you think you're going, my boy?
Don't you want to say "good evening" to an old friend like me?
We caught the thief.
But who killed the man whose body lies on the floor?
He's innocent!
He killed him to protect my honour.
This ruby is part of the gem collection that has been stolen from the Duke of Axminster.
How did it come to be in your possession?
What day was the theft committed?
If so, then I can prove my husband's innocence.
I can provide him with an alibi, with the help of my diary. I keep it in the winter garden.
Werner!
Thank God you are here!
Now you can confirm to my husband that I have told the truth.
I feel all the weight of my guilt.
If you left me, I would deserve it
...Harry!
I love you, Harry. And I will wait faithfully for you until you have paid for your misdeeds, as I have always been faithful to you.

God bless you... shepherd!
God bless you...
Welcome and have a rest.
Dear me, what a man you are, square-built like Jánošík.
What?
What, shepherd?
Like who?
Begad, like Jánošík who used to live here.
Jurko Jánošík did not know what was going on at home when he was coming back to see his old parents after two years of studies and distress.
Little bread, much work!
God bless you...
I am exhausted after the long journey.
Could I have some water?
Enjoy it. To your health!
Oh, this is our neighbour Anka. Yes, Anka!
Pišta.
It happened two years ago.
Easy, easy. The kiss is hot you could burn your moustache.
Do not leave yet!
Oh no!
Through the scarf only!
Well-known cottages.
Jánošík's friend and protector.
I have not seen my father and mother yet.
How are they?
Are they healthy?
Dear father!
Where is mom?
Mom, my dear mom!
The old Jánošík was not at work again!
My wife died.
She would not have jumped out of the coffin even if you came to work.
Fifty strokes with a stick!
Go and tell Jánošík they are beating his father.
How can you? You, you!
It is good the monk is here, we can save on the funeral.
And he was beaten so badly that he died on the same day.
At the village.
To work!
To work!
Think it over and you will never have to work for your lords.
They chase him, so Jánošík hides in a cave.
Oh, mother, mother dear, A long way from here. I cry longing for you Want to be near.
Bless you.
Thank you, Anka.
No!
Do not leave!
I thought there was nobody to look after my parents' graves. But you...
Annie, you are an angel!
No, Annie, I shall not become a priest.
The bloody nobs make it impossible.
You cannot run away this time!
We shall catch him and earn a hundred ducats as a reward.
An uninvited witness.
Well, you can fight pretty well, father.
I am not a priest yet and probably shall never be one.
This dog and Šándor took me everything and chased me like an animal.
Is it you, Jánošík from Terchová?
Is it really you?
Welcome!
I am Hrajnoha, the bandits' captain.
We nearly forgot about that one.
Pay a fine.
Hey, there's a grove up the way. There's a path up the way. My father was a good fellow.
Fellows! Here - Jánošík - our new companion - let him be our captain!
Long live Jánošík!
Long live our new captain!
Dear friends!
I should have been a priest but Satan crossed my plans.
Do you want me to be your captain?
Well then, I accept.
I promise to be your fair leader!
As so far, we shall go on protecting the serfs.
We will help them in all possible ways.
Our will - our strength.
Let the serfs benefit from all our doings!
The lords take us everything - our properties, freedom, lives - we shall not spare them! But remember, we shall not kill anybody!
Death shall not change anybody.
Long live Jánošík!
Long live our captain!
The walls in the Count Šándor's mansion were the silent witnesses of the gentry's wild life.
Not every squire is a good squire. The Hungarian squire is the best!
In the neighbouring domain. Visitors are coming.
His nobility - Baron Révay.
Oh, what a pleasant surprise!
Well, Your Nobility, will you pay your debt at last?
Of course I will!
Yes, I was just checking how much I got.
How many times shall I mention my 5.OOO guldens?
I will put you up for public auction!
Is it still the old wine?
Lo! What wine?
Well, will you sell me a bushel?
To sell?
It will be a present from me, sir!
Oh no, it would be much waste, I shall buy it.
Believe me, sir, upon my squire word, if the crop was in the barns I would pay you immediately. But where to get money now?
And what about the peasants? Could they not pay your debt?
What do you mean?
Well, it is simple.
Each peasant will pay 5O pennies.
Those who do not have the money will pay in produce.
The Jew will buy them and you will get money!
Well, sir, tell my servant not to get the horses until tomorrow.
Hereby we announce that our venerable lord and owner Count Šándor orders his serfs to pay 5O pennies. Those who have no money, will pay the tax in goods.
Those who refuse will be beaten and put in the stocks!
Give me back my pots!
I have nothing to pay the tax with. I could not pay you for your work.
Well, I shall mend them gratis.
After a short while.
Really cheap.
Did he pay?
I am coming to collect the tax in the afternoon.
It was very good advice, indeed.
We are even now.
You can use my advice also next time.
Fellows, I must go down to the village.
And you, Hrajnoha, Take care of Baron Révay!
The serf cannot rest even on Sunday.
When will a squire keep his word?
The daughter is alone, isn't she?
You will not work hard in this cabin any more, you will come with me to my manor-house.
You must be sensible, you will be well in the manor-house.
Oh, you are like a scared little animal. Do not be so stubborn.
You will soon forget about that bandit!
Here he is, the bandit!
Well, so this is the bandit nest, isn't it? But you shall not escape this time!
You coward!
Well, you will pay for those words!
At the father's protection.
Father, help me. Rescue Annie from Šándor!
Dear son, what path did you take?
Oh, Father, do not condemn me. You know the soul of the suffering serfs.
Oh, mercy!
Be a father to my Anka!
Jánošík took care of the poor serfs, helped them together with the local priest and other secret friends.
Evening at the parish house.
What Šándor's people took, cannot be given back.
Here, Jánošík is sending you some ducats for the damage.
Meeting at the county administrator's place.
Is the Hungarian squire not the master and lord of his peasants any more?
Should we let these dirty bandits order us what to do and want not to do?
Well, do you know what happened at the last county ball?
Before midnight... When everybody was having a good time...
You rob from the serfs, I rob from you.
And each of your sins will be punished.
You let my father be beaten to death!
You took everything from me!
Remember, you shall not escape my revenge!
And we should take this?
This is not a good order!
Gentlemen, I promise you to clear your county of this group of bandits.
Here, Commissioner will give you soldiers.
The trap is ready.
Is his lover hiding at the parish?
Where has the bandit's lover gone?
And you, foolish old man, give the bandits' money to peasants?
Your master will throw you out of the parish.
I have resigned myself to anything.
Well, old man, is there some wine for your guest?
Hey, old woman! Has some bandit fallen in love with you yet?
What brought you here? What can I do for you?
I came to confess.
But this time you will confess to me!
Does the bandit come here often?
He does not.
Why do you not bring the girl here?
What for?
What for?
So she can tell me where the bandit is.
I do not know.
You know where he is, too.
Tell me, you old fool!
Don't you know it?
You! ?
Jánošík!
For goodness sake, save yourself! Soldiers!
Go away! Away!
Come on, Mišo! Come on!
Let the house shake!
While at the farm...
Look out, fellows!
Prepare your pistols, get ready and follow me!
No, Jánošík! We must not lose you!
I am the first to go.
In the name of His Majesty, surrender, Jánošík!
Eternal peace.
The verdict. As the accused and his, already punished, companions, are found guilty, having been accused of many felonies: Arson, robbery and even murder, he is sentenced to death!
So as to warn others, the punishment differs from others and Jánošík is sentenced to be hung by his left rib on a hook and quartered after his death! Let the sentence be carried out without delay!
Such was the death of Jánošík, the first fighter for freedom of the Slovak people.
Thank you, shepherd.
Take care!

Part II:
Hell.
A drama of people of our time.
Prelude
Dr. Mabuse, the great gambler ... playing with people ... and their destinies has ordered an attack through to be committed through ... the dancer ... Cara Carozza ... against his pursuer ..., State Attorney von Wenk, Young Hull was her victim.
Carozza has been arrested.
Through the power of his will,
Countess Told, whom he loves.
Dear Mr. von Wenk:
I agreed under false pretenses to sound out Miss Carozza in prison.
I thought that I would find the paid tout of a notorious criminal -- only to find a woman full of love, before whose simple and unconditional feelings...
I am not suitable to be your ally
Please forgive me if for that reason I have to disappoint you
The sleeping woman -- --
I am not suitable to be your ally
Yours, Dusy Told, Countess
Only now shall the world learn who I am!
I! Mabuse! A giant -- a titan who jumbles up laws and gods ... like withered leaves!
Count Told, would you not like to confide what happened to you?
I have cheated in the game ...
I cheated at cards!
I cheated--! Yes--!
I who usually never touch a card - - I had such a streak of luck!
frankly, it scared me.
Were all your guests old acquaintances?
All, except one ... whom my wife had invited the psychoanalyst Dr. Mabuse.
But he did not join in the game.
My wife has left me ... Surely she has gone home to her mother ... because she does not want to share her life with a card-cheat --.
Don't you trust any doctor at all?
Some experienced psychiatrist in whom you could confide?
Dr. Mabuse...?
If I'd turn to Dr. Mabuse?
Useless, Countess.
Count Told is on the phone!
Doctor, you were present ... when I had that-- accident at the card table...
I need your medical help.
I treat patients only in their homes!
End of Act I
Ready!
They will move her to the women's prison.
The eleventh hour -
Your case interests me -
- I will treat you.
For as long as you are under my treatment you will not leave the house, not receive anybody, not speak to anybody.
You must not see anyone who reminds you of your former life!
As from today I am not available to anyone, neither personally nor by telephone
Tell everybody asking for me or the Countess that we have gone away for an indefinite time!"
Please connect me to Count Told.
The Countess is not staying with her mother!
I am sorry, but sir and madam are away!
I am sorry, Mr. State Attorney, but sir and madam left this morning!
My brother has sent a colleague with the message that La Carozza has been taken to the women's prison.
The blind -- --
If by some damned coincidence they got on my track
I'll get away through this tunnel.
From underneath a gentle push will lift the door!
Put on something decent and report to me
Captivity ...
Be careful!
My sudden disappearance will not go unnoticed.
Your friends?
Unless the State Attorney really hurries up, he won't have much more time to free you!"
And your husband ... ?
Your husband is under my medical treatment,
You'd better not speak of your husband!
Do not dare even to think of him! You will be pronouncing his death sentence if you mention his name in my presence!"
Good God, hurry up!
For a while I'd be ... in a jail ... for women!
Your situation is only your fault, Miss Carozza.
Why are you so obstinate, Miss Carozza? If you'd assist us in clearing up Hull's murder,
You are sacrificing yourself for a scoundrel who has simply abandoned you -- and in vain -- for we are already on his tail!
He is stronger than all of you!
He destroys anybody he wants too!
I am supposed to check the electrical wiring in here...
The man for whose sake you are here has thrown you away like a squeezed fruit.
... like a squeezed fruit strip.
He knows very well that it might cost you your head - and he does not lift a finger to help you-- -- and who can guarantee that no other woman has long since replaced you in his heart?
Give me two days time ...
I have to go get a ladder ...
When will Wenk be back?
Wenk has managed to wear down La Carozza.
Then we must liquidate!
That will cost you your life, my boy!
But ... Why?
I have not done anything to him!
I'll try an experiment ...
I will confront him with La Carozza. Perhaps one of them will give themselves away -- or both ... ...
End of Act II
Act III
He has killed her --!
Who?
Who?
No, no, no ... I will not say anything ... or the same thing will happen to me!
Take this man to police headquarters under double guard and with every conceivable precaution!
You should go down a road different from usual !
And if I have to cross-examine you for 48 hours...
I will get the name out of you! You may count on that!"
They arrested Johannes Gutter!
They're taking him to police headquarters!
All his life Johannes Gutter has devoted himself to our just cause!
That's why he has been taken from our midst now!
Are we going to put up with that? !
We will not let him down!
We will free him!
They are not taking the usual route!
They are going through Mueller Street!
Johannes Gutter!
Johannes Gutter!
Release Johannes Gutter!
Be sensible, folks!
The prisoner we're transporting. is not Johannes Gutter at all!
See for yourselves that the prisoner is not Gutter.
But then be sensible and clear the path!"
Where have the people with the prisoner got to?
After the incident with La Carozza, I will not have a minute of peace ... I won't rest until I know that fellow to be in your special care!
Carozza was thoroughly searched when she was brought in.
How did she suddenly get the poison?
Even in the women's prison, the Great Unknown must have his accomplices!
In Mueller Street we suddenly could not get any further!
God knows who incited those people--!
Wake up to the Countess ... and tell her that I wish to speak to her.
I've never seen that person before.
None of us knew him!
But since he shot his mouth off -- --
You wished to speak to me?
The game between us must end -- one way -- or the other!
I am no longer the man I used to be.
I make mistakes ...
losing my nerve ...
I intend to leave this city, this country, Countess and I have come to ask if you want to join me.
I want you to be mine!
For the last time, Countess, will you follow me of your free will -- or as a prisoner?
Never! Do you hear me? ...
Never!
I want to return to my husband!
You have now pronounced pronounced his death sentence--
Nocturnal phantoms --
The day ...
Dr. Mabuse!
Your condition has deteriorated
-- you are sicker than ever!
Do you know that your wife wants to commit you to an insane asylum?
Your wife has left you --
Forever!
Your life is ruined -- you cannot go on living -- -
- - Not go on living -- !
The Count must be left absolutely alone - any disturbance could be fatal!"
Not go on living!
With the razor -- --!
End Act III
Act IV
Where is the Countess?
I have not seen her ... since that terrible night at the card game!
hen why did you tell me on the telephone that the Master and Mistress had gone away?
I was ordered to do so by the Count.
In my humble opinion, Sir, the master grew really bad only after
Dr. Mabuse treated him.
Since we are going abroad tomorrow, Countess here are the people who will have the honor to be at your service!
I want to return to my husband!
Your husband is dead ... !
If there is any human feeling in you --
If there is any human feeling in you --
Let me go to my husband!
I'm going to personally visit Dr. Mabuse.
Do you know the address?
Dr. Mabuse, Psychoanalysis
I am very sorry, the doctor is out!
No news, Mr. Prosecutor.
With your permission:
Dr. Mabuse!
What a strange coincidence, Doctor! I have just come from your house.
Now come from home.
I wanted to inform you of the suicide of your patients, Count Told!
And I, State Attorney von Wenk, came to ask your help in preventing just such a tragedy!
The case of Count Told is so unusual from beginning to end that I have become convinced that both as card-cheat and as suicide, the Count acted under the compulsion of some overpowering, but to him, hostile mind!"
Are you familiar with Weltmann's experiments?
Today! Today! An Evening of Experiments Sandor Weltmann
Hypnosis, Trance, Natural Magnetism, The Secrets.
of the Indian Fakirs. The Secrets of the Psyche.
The Subconscious in Man and Animal.
In the Main Auditorium of Philharmonic Hall At 8 o'clock
You would there see with your own eyes how Weltmann due to his tremendous suggestive powers, is able to compel people to act in a way diametrically opposite to their nature ... ...
--preferably, people who try to resist his influence--
And you believe Count Told fell victim to such an overpowering influence of some unknown enemy?
You have roused my curiosity, Doctor I will follow your suggestion!
Forgive me just one more question, Doctor:
do you happen to know the whereabouts of Countess Told?
How come you let that gentleman into my office without informing me?
Are not even you to be relied on any more?
As soon as you see Wenk approaching, start the engine and let him pass.
Then you come back here as quickly as possible!
This time his whole bodyguard won't save the State Attorney!
I don't know if Sandor Weltmann himself is the puppeteer.
In any case, we are dealing with an opponent where the improbable is the most likely of all things expected.
That means you'll just have to act on your own initiative--

In the Main Auditorium of Philharmonic Hall 8 o'clock
Ladies and gentlemen!
I would next like to demonstrate to you a case of typical mass suggestion such as is the power base of the Hindu Fakirs.
Would somebody please call out a couple of two-digit numbers!
If the ladies and gentlemen occupying the seats with those numbers are agreeable to my conducting some experiments with them, would they please rise. That is, 64 and 12. All right; 64 and 12.
Seat number 12 is empty!
Perhaps the gentleman at number 11 would be so kind--
In the right inside pocket of your jacket you have two 1000 - Mark notes issued in 1918, Series D and Series No. 65045 No.
F 5567 , a weapon license, one identity card; in your left inside pocket you carry a Browning -- is that correct?
Would you please read out what it says on the note?
The lady from number 64 shall remove the Browning from the inside pocket of the Gentleman at number 11 and give it to the Gentleman at number 5!
Would the Gentleman at number 11 be so kind as to be available for one more experiment?"
Then I would ask you, as well as a few other ladies and gentleman,
to come up and join me on the stage!"
A new experiment! This Gentleman will be so kind and carry out what I have written down in this sealed envelope
-Nan -Fu
Tsi-Nan-Fu
Dr. Ma ..
Do what I have written down!
You conduct the lady to her seat, leave the auditorium, get into the car number 3825 waiting outside the door, and drive at full speed over the mountain road into the quarry. Melior!
The note says:
You lead the lady to her seat, leave the auditorium, go home and go to bed!
This thing gives me an eerie feeling!
Boss, the "Great Unknown" we are looking for
Dr. Mabuse, doctor, gambler, criminal--!
To the closest police station!
And as fast as possible!
Finale
I'll look after the car, you wake Fine and the Countess!
Let the Doctor sleep as long as possible. After last night's business, He was completely exhausted.
We can't get out, the police have surrounded the house!
Then -- we'll give them a fight!
End of Act V
Act VI
They are resisting more stubbornly than we anticipated.
The men should keep under cover ... until I give further instructions!
A telephone conversation --
This is State Attorney von Wenk speaking!
Doctor Mabuse, I request you not to resist the forces of justice.
I don't know anything about your 'justice'.
If you want me -- get me!"
We are determined to proceed against you with the fiercest means!
Give up your pointless resistance!
I allow myself to draw your attention to the fact that Countess Told is also in the house!
We must get the army to help us!
Dr. Mabuse has a prisoner ... Told ... the countess.
We have to storm the house quickly, otherwise the lady's life will be in danger!
Doctor!
The army is coming--!
And you snort coke, you chicken!
Let the woman go, Doctor!
Save yourself!
Where is Mabuse?
Shut up, Spoerri!
Remember Pesch!
--Home--!
Caught--!
Will he keep his mouth shut, this weed? !
These objects were found on the dead in Mabuse's house, Sir!
And Hawasch is dead ... and Fine ...
It's the key ... ... to Hawasch's counterfeiting plant he may have taken refuge there --!
Take over the bank, Dr. Mabuse..."

Enough!
I will hear no more!
It's disgusting, appalling!
But yet... I who thought it up, hatched it out in nights, in nights... ah!
You do not know!
For you it's a game spicing what else life offers you willingly.
But to me! A thirsty one!
One who is at the point of pining away... mocked, harassed, abused by tortures which...
That nature gave me, together with this face and this hump, such feelings, such greed... I beg you, quiet! Ah!
The devil! The guardians of order are on watch and full of ambition.
Behind the doors the bribed servants are lurking,
- in the gardens henchmen are hiding.
- You exaggerate, my friend.
Scruples too profound are really out of place.
The fact that we are not satisfied with peasant girls and maidens, with merchants' daughters and hussies, that we choose the finest and prettiest, is a proof of our taste.
What was the watchword you gave us some weeks ago?
""Beauty be prey of the strong.""
""All splendour of the world succumb to the power of mind,""
""and the conqueror's glory shine brighter""
""and penetrate deeper, more painfully into the souls""
""than the brilliance which merely dazzles the eye.""
- lt's true!
- Thus you spoke.
- And since then...
- What you created you shun.
You even avoid us!
None of the clandestine festivities has welcomed you!
Just because a few fathers wring their hands and a few mothers cry heart-rendingly!
Just don't think the beauties themselves are angry with us.
Yesterday Alissa, the little Jewess, you should have seen her face!
And the amazing daughter of Biparetto the poet, really, she was lovely!
We snatch them from their lovers' arms heavy with everyday burdens!
The misunderstood woman weeps not for the husband inexperienced in love!
Out of cramped rooms into wide, mystic spaces...
All fairy tales come to life, all dreams of secret nights...
Dreams of the Orient, they come true!
What no one admits and everyone longs for suddenly is reality!
Quite so, quite so... lt is convincing.
But in one point, pardon me, for me it's not quite right.
You always only speak about yourself who are good-looking and endowed with charm, and you forget me, the cripple.
If he came to the festivities, as you demand, he would spoil them... and instead of lust horror would pave its way.
My friend, it seems to me that you overrate enormously the way women feel about beauty.
There were spring nights.
Through open windows it came in, dancing.
All sensuous magic, scent of flowers, heavy and inebriating.
And I had to leave, tossed by a fever, out into lonely lanes.
And I searched for a strumpet, a really depraved one.
Spoke to her, offered her gold, a lot of gold, still I felt like the beggar asking for alms.
By the light of the street lamp she looked me up and down with eyes... a smile...
so humiliating that my blood ran cold.
There the gold had an effect!
On coloured lips its blaze reflected my misery's dreadful need.
Lascivious words promised agreement, but I didn't have the strength to spit at myself and to desecrate the spring night.
My lord, the notary.
- For goodness, Alviano...
- You're capable of...
What's the notary supposed to do?
Don't worry!
Would you ask him to be patient for a short time.
What for?
What's your plan?
I forgot to confide it to you.
My island Elysium, with all its buildings, fountains and resplendent gardens, with all its miracles of art unheard of and rare treasures of generous nature,
as a donation I left it for perpetuity to the city.
You're out of your senses!
You don't know what you're doing!
Your life's work!
You spent half your fortune on it; you wasted it, thoughtlessly.
Tomorrow evening, after dusk, in the presence of the Senate and the PodestÁ, I'll officially announce it
to the people.
Gentlemen, you are invited.
But, for goodness, do you forget... I considered everything.
You hand us over!
The access to the underground hall... lf you fear discovery, avoid it from now on.
But excuse me now.
I await the town councillors and, together with the notary, I must lay down the wording and articles of the donation.
- Hello!
Vitelozzo!
- l am late.
- We see! - And out of breath!
My friends...
What's up?
I am bewildered!
Sancta Maria, what happened?
- Deeply moved...
- Oh, God!
Unhappy one!
...by such beauty!
- Ah!
- l thought so!
- A woman!
- Of course!
- No!
- A goddess.
- An angel.
- A flower.
- We know this.
- Please, be quiet!
Where did you see this beauty?
I came past the town hall when the city elders drove up in their coaches for some festivity.
Maybe there is... what do you think... ln one of them, listen...
My greetings, gentlemen, and thanks that my modest home has been honoured by such distinguished guests.
Your modest home?
O noble Sir Salvago, you are too unassuming.
The splendour of the rooms we walked through is unequalled in all of Genoa.
Your compliment makes me happy.
But please permit:
here are my friends, the best of Genoa's aristocracy.
You will recognize the names of illustrious descents.
This is my only child, my beloved daughter Carlotta.
I am afraid, sir, maybe you find her too liberal-minded.
She has, to my regret, a low opinion of social rules.
The admiration of your generosity and a very special request to you, she... I bid you welcome and, if I had the privilege to fulfil the young lady's desire, I would call myself lucky!
But now, if you allow, we, delegated from the Senate,
want to bring to you the gratitude and the joyful amazement of the noble assembly.
Your document announces a donation to us, so great and important, so unexpected and seldom these days.
It's hard for the citizen to preserve his paltry possessions.
Gold he arduously worked for runs through his fingers like water, and yet... taxes increase even more.
We endured it, mostly patiently and grumbling but rarely, since the treasure of our family's sanctity remained to us and the belief in our Madonna.
But there it breaks in like a wolf into the flock and robs us of our wives and kidnaps our daughters and without defence, without help...
But forgive me, sir, to complain to you about our sorrows was really not our delegation's intention.
For the first ray of light, after scared days, we have to thank you!
The island's auspicious name, for us it augurs well.
Do you remember, Signorina, a rider this morning, his black horse took fright at the sight of the coaches.
The Duke Adorno... right of objection... we're dependent...
What could he object...
The rider looked into two sparkling eyes and, confused by them, he forgot to rein in the horse and nearly made an unwilling bow to the beauty, so that was you?
- l was very amused.
- You are cruel.
And if, by falling off his horse, an arm or leg were broken...
A glance from my eyes, isn't it worth it for you?
I'd gladly give my life for you, yet...
And if this were just what I wanted?
You are so great, so mighty and strong, so far above me... I have to stretch myself, look, just to look into your eyes, oh, so sure of victory.
And I'd like to see you small and low and poor, far beneath me, reachable to my feet...
The dead are poor.
But dead and mute.
I love the soul that fights and struggles, that sacrifices itself and suffers for love's reward.
If you're dead one day, what use is my love to you then?
Have you gone mad, young lady!
The answer... I will think about it
and I will answer you tomorrow.
Wait, Vitelozzo! Why in such a hurry?
- Listen!
- We're in danger!
He is to hand us over to those lousy citizens!
- The access to the underground hall!
- By Madonna,
- We must stop it!
- let me go!
Talk to Adorno!
Do what you want, but leave me out of it!
- But you... one word!
- l know nothing, I want nothing, I am in love, I love...
Do you hear?
The plague upon you!
That's settled then:
you'll give us one more day.
The Senate will request the Duke's permission first.
And tonight you will be my guest.
As now you are mine.
I beg my noble guests not to disdain my invitation, just a simple meal.
Signorina, your arm!
You're highly amusing,
- Sir Alviano, really...
- Do you feel better then?
I was scared; suddenly you reached for your heart
- Ah, little one, I am as fit as a fiddle.
But did my father not tell you about a request?
Yes, indeed.
So quickly you forget such important things?
- No, but...
- Well, you see... in front of the people it wouldn't have worked!
And as all my winks, my furtive signs, my asking whether you possessed a painting or a rare sculpture to show me, as all this didn't help I had the idea...
You must take me for a dolt, ignorant of life, naive and silly.
Ah, indeed!
Yet I rarely have the pleasure to associate with pretty women... that's why that... do you understand?
I understand.
But listen.
I paint.
Yes, really. Don't look so amazed.
I do paintings.
Animals and men, trees and lakes... the sky, the light... but I like best painting souls.
And you can?
I mean, do you succeed in painting souls?
I don't know whether I can, and if I fail then it seems to me it's not always my fault.
You hardly find models.
Only once it seemed to be successful.
The picture appeared, so wondrously fine.
Just an ugly shadow between chin and mouth...
Look there... and ponder and try as I would, it appeared again and again.
Already I thought it gone and banished for ever. There, all of a sudden, insidiously it crept out of the brushes and took root!
This picture I gave up.
A long time I didn't attempt anything.
But you... You I'd love to paint.
Me?
Damn it, are you out of your wits?
I see!
It had to happen.
I really thought you took me seriously, you were different from the others, the snakes with gentle faces, with enticing eyes and hearts like devils.
But just now I've seen it: the same look.
Oh, goodness, collect yourself!
Perhaps as a fool in a painting among pretty men and women, an effective contrast, with a fool's cap, the hump would fit in quite well, for the people to jeer at for all time!
Hush now!
Don't forget that you are speaking to a lady.
You do me wrong.
Hear me out.
Where the town widens and the view opens on to the countryside,
there I have a cottage for a studio.
Early in the morning, the lanes and squares still deserted and empty, when the wan morning light is lapping around the canvas, colourless and soft,
then to me it seems the right time for work.
A road goes past my cottage, lined by tall cypresses.
You know it well.
You often walked on it,
shy and bowed down, lost in thought...
Suddenly suspiciously watching the windows, whose curtains hide the observer.
But you did not see her.
Then arose, purple glowing, veils shimmering in a thousand colourings, shining mists like eerie heralds came along, announcing its approach: the sun...
And a second miracle took place:
I saw the small, wretched wanderer raise his head.
Every muscle tensed up in the frail body.
The arms raised up into the sky.
Thus he walked into the glare, towards the sun.
And I saw him becoming taller and taller, the figure was growing enormously.
My heart was beating.
Thus I was painting you, Signor Alviano.
Thus I was painting your figure:
walking towards the sun.
But still I need the face and still I need the drunken eye
in which all beauty will be reflected.
I am ashamed... I don't know... pardon me... I have never felt like this in my life!
Will you come to my studio so that I can complete the painting?
I'll be glad to come.
He's playing cat and mouse with us.
He has become far too mighty, the noble sir!
His last triumph over Branciforte went to his head.
The people have spoilt him.
- After all, they are indebted to him. - They pay him.
A noble mercenary, nothing more.
- How are things going?
- He didn't say.
Not for and against.
On the one hand it would be welcome for the people of Genoa, on the other hand the aristocracy would regret if it were to lose a valuable property.
His heart would beat for the people, would decide in its favour.
But fairness and consideration for his friends would call him for caution, he ought to think it over and discuss it and similar catchphrases.
With all his heart he envies us the donation.
He detests the whole affair.
The man of the day is Alviano Salvago!
The whole town is praising his name.
My daughter Carlotta, who is not easily conquered, spoke of him often, imagining his character.
Now he has taken her by storm.
Duke Adorno ought to be wary!
He ought to be wary, Duke Adorno!
Do you hear it?
- This is the public mood.
- Does the mob frighten you?
You spoke differently yesterday.
Well, yesterday...
Don't remind me!
Do you speak to your friend like this?
Excuse me.
But isn't it enough that I disdain myself?
is your mockery supposed to turn a knife in my wounds and my friends' laughter to drive me mad?
What ails you, Tamare?
I do not recognize you.
The most brilliant gentleman of my court, like nobody else honoured,
beloved, idolized by the women, constantly in the mood for the most incredible pranks.
There are people who only see the light and darkness is alien to them.
I was one of that kind.
Life seemed to me a source of constant joy from which I drank with thirsty gulps, careless, without thinking.
When I stretched out my hand, I held the rose, drew in its fragrance and pulled the petals off.
When I dropped to the ground, I fell softly on moss, thorns shunned me as well as sharp stones.
When a friend poured out his heart to me I heard him perfectly well, but I did not understand him.
And now I have experienced at once all torment of hell, humiliation and disgrace.
Explain yourself.
Beautiful as the daylight, but not of equal rank with me...
- a bourgeois child. - Well.
And then?
When I spoke to her the first time I think I did not understand her right.
She asked for a sacrifice as a pledge of my love.
But what she desired...
a lot of nonsense, madness, born at that moment I tried to understand, to interpret following the rules of courtly manners.
After a night of battling I thought I'd found it and mounted my horse, free and proud like a god, my filled heart puffed up with noble feelings.
And I rode through the town and, lost in dreams, I drew up the courting and I saw the beauty flush happily, stunned and moved by the honour!
A Count Andrae Vitelozzo Tamare offers heart and hand...
You are really mad.
Be patient, Duke!
When I stood before her, like the first time, at once I fell in despair.
The strange look in her eyes, her cool and amazed smile confused me.
But to guard timid heart I behaved haughtily, arrogant and gruffly, I talked about the sacrifice I would make for her more evil than self-mutilation and death...
And since I finally got her ""No"", I completely lost the remnants of my senses.
I threw myself at her feet, about my possessions I wildly talked gibberish.
Clasping her knees I implored her for forgiveness and mercy!
Tamare, pull yourself together.
Do you hear, Vitelozzo?
Who is this woman?
The PodestÁ's daughter, Carlotta.
Ah!
An important painter once mentioned her name to me as that of a rare talent.
I'd like to warn you for some reasons, but I know the futility of such an action and how he who warns is detested by him who loves unfortunately.
That's why I prefer helping you instead of giving advice to you.
Ah, if you could... I will court for you.
You don't know this woman.
But I know women.
That's why I hope for you.
But promise me one thing:
if I bring back a bad message, if I return with empty hands, then do not rage against yourself and me, be strong, don't despair, shake it off and forget this woman!
Listen, Duke, I want to forget her.
I want to forget her.
But first she has to be mine.
Not until I have drunk the breath of her mouth and my hands are soaked with the scent of her hair, not until this woman, if she refuses to be my wife, has been my whore!
That'll stir up bad feelings!
We are bound by law and order like everybody else.
Don't forget.
My friends sent me to appeal to you:
you may prevent that Alviano's island, Elysium,
- pass into the town's possession.
- Damn it, what has Salvago, what has the island to do with your heinous intrigues?
On that island an artificial grotto makes wonderful rooms accessible,
especially created for love's celebrations.
When you enter the grotto, a blue light dazzles your eyes.
Heavy fragrances confuse your senses, crimson flames, flaring up like visions, distant music and soft singing lure you deeper and deeper.
A narrow path leads to the cave's entrance, hidden by shrubs of roses.
But if someone discovers the grotto's secret then we are lost.
Does Salvago know about your doing?
Salvago, ha ha!
A whim of nature, if you like, a strange caprice.
Genoa's ugliest man is the creator of this adventure,
of this materialized idea of beauty.
And he himself... He himself keeps away.
Maybe he has regrets.
But I don't understand it.
The torches' glow gilds everything.
In the orgy's frenzy ugliness becomes beautiful, and beauty becomes ugly.
The contrasts vanish in the rapture!
And this fool Salvago, after he cultivated on his land blooms of vice and poisonous plants of sin... he gives up the land and himself and you?
He warned us.
Yet he did not consider how difficult it is to control passion, once it is unbridled.
That is my curse: your immoderation.
Your unbridled passion compels me to actions I condemn!
I will rescue what can still be rescued.
I will keep my promise to you because your love keeps you from the company of miscreants and because of our friendship since youth.
Beware, Vitelozzo, you have been warned of violence.
Salvago ought to restrain his urge for donation for a long time.
This benefactor of people, he will obey, or woe to him and woe to you all!
Our times are full of strange things.
I knew a woman, like me she learned to paint at the Antwerp School, she painted hands.
Fine, slim hands with delicate blue-veined structures, rough and strong fists of men,
a woman's hand with rings, voluptuous and tender, with nails, pointed and rosy, flashing like drops of pale blood.
There I saw a hand which dug its nails in healthy flesh and another plucked with gentle fingers a twig, growing out of green bushes.
But the oddest thing was one painting:
a hand, waxen and pale, pale as death, with weird long and skinny fingers,
it was grasping something you could not see.
Only a faint reddish gleam penetrated the eerie fingers, but this glow was like a silent dirge,
like a suppressed moaning cry, like a scream, restrained and in mortal fear,
like a restrained cry for release...
But, the painting's meaning?
The poor one probably never felt what inspires artists to great works:
the happiness of love or the ardent desire for it.
She may have been anxious that once on her path of life she might encounter an event, some sensuously intoxicating charm to which she would surrender.
How strange, fear of happiness?
The driving force of this poor life was greed for fame and the fountain from which it was nourished was pain.
Not mentally, a physical pain.
Your hand, Signorina, is not as steady as your voice, if you want to paint...
No.
You are wrong!
My hand is quite steady and the story soon comes to an end.
My friend suffered from her heart since her youth.
All too often it would beat too passionately and sometimes she felt as if a merciless hand clutched at the twitching thing and squeezed it, dreadful and aching,
so that it may come to rest!
This hand, this cruel hand
she painted and her pain, too.
Even though you deny it, you are deeply moved, so it really touched you?
I loved her...
So she died?
I think she is still alive.
Tell me of your youth or why you are so gloomy and in such a bad mood today... or rather why your eyes so fearfully evade mine.
What have I done? Are you angry with me?
Signorina Carlotta, if this is nothing but a game for you, the pleasure of playing around or even worse, then you are, despite your sweet face and your voice which sounds like a message from heaven, a devil!
Why should I who am so good to you be as vicious and evil as you describe me?
I implore you, don't be angry with me!
Just have some patience with me!
I don't understand: it is like a dream and I fear...
No, do not fear!
You are a man and totally without any self-confidence.
is it so unthinkable that a woman should find herself in love and friendship for you?
Ha ha!
The old story!
But the way you look, with eyes whose glow alone is promise...
And when your mouth smiles I feel as if on earth there were nothing that is named ""friendship"", as if this word, this miserable word, were an absurdity, a lie and disgrace!
And if it were more...
I do not say it is...
Should there be on this earth among millions of beating hearts not to be found one that strives for you in love?
For me... me who hates himself, who flees from himself, who banished the mirrors out of his rooms!
A fool you are!
Who like nobody else clings to that which slips away like a day in May:
this bit of beauty which leaves us women when the first furrow is on its way!
We are scarcely conscious of spring, when buds turn to fruit.
The leaves wither and fall.
And this should be the one thing?
Did you never go out on a sunny day, gloomy and sad, without knowing why?
And not even the most outstanding person, not the most flourishing tree could rescue you from your anxiety.
And some other time, on rainy days, did it not make you happy, even overjoyed, to see an old, lonely man, wrinkled and ugly, who went on his way and looked at you with naive eyes?
But if, on a glorious day, in a bed of the loveliest flowers, you were to find a grim monster which put you in a bad mood?
But I notice one thing:
you evade me, once with looks, now with words.
But I have to tell you.
Carlotta, consider...
You shall know that I love you.
Carlotta!
For God's sake, Signor, how you do stare at me!
There, take my hands, kiss them quickly!
But let me go on working.
I need your eyes for my painting.
Thus they are right for me.
Carlotta!
Beloved!
I beg you, do not speak.
Just look at me just straight, look deeply into my eyes and think about beautiful things, that I am your sun that chases away all darkness from your life with streaming light.
For God's sake, Carlotta, I must at your feet.
I am happy beyond words.
I beg you, stay.
Just look at me and consider that never again will you be lonely and unloved despite your ugliness.
See how calmly I say the word which tormented you for so long.
Now it's over.
Since it's a word... and a concept...
Nothing more.
But you must be good to me, Alviano, and tender, my dear!
Because I am quite a fragile toy.
Carlotta!
That's it, it's finished.
Now come and hold me.
I am exhausted, yet you must...
For all saints' sake...
Dear, what happens to you?
You sweet, poor one...
You loveliest one!
You gave life to me, you gave back to me the belief in God and mankind.
I want to consecrate to you all I have.
I want to spread myself out beneath your feet.
I want to be infinitely good to you and tender.
Lady!
Duke Adorno!
The Duke, what on earth can he want?
Please tell him to wait.
Since yesterday I have been hearing voices everywhere.
Singing in the air and murmuring in the bushes...
Carlotta's silvery laugh a while ago, but probably it was a delusion.
Ah, sir, how changed and happy I am since the day you first entered my house.
Your daughter, so soon to be my wife, how beautiful beyond words she is, so full of sincere kindness.
But you are reserved.
What troubles you, PodestÁ?
I am bewildered and dazzled.
What you have just shown me, it is incredible that the brain of a single man should have thought up this realm of magic!
Many people helped me.
The artists were active.
I only contributed the yearning.
- But where is Carlotta?
- Come on, let us look for her.
Did you not hear?
They are looking for you, Carlotta, and you hide yourself in the shadows. Then you run away from your fiancé?
Don't think badly of me, Duke.
After all I don't know what happens to me.
Yesterday when I answered you ""No"" for Count Vitelozzo I felt proud and secure, grand and joyful.
But yet, since I finished the painting, which pleased you so much,
the portrait of Alviano,
it seems to me as if something had grown weary within me, as if my love were no longer the same.
Not poorer, don't get me wrong.
But as though now he had given me his all, his everything and as though I had nothing... nothing more to expect.
And further... yet I don't know if a woman's conflicting feelings are of interest to you or whether they provoke your scorn, Duke?
Pray, trust me, how true and authentic you are,
Signorina!
I came to this island full of secret fear.
As if I had drunk wine, heavy and mixed with enchanting herbs, or that strange drink, brewed with the blood from the heart of a love-stricken virgin!
It is the dreadful spell of beauty, normally bound, half-concealed from the senses and now raging, exposed to the daylight and lecherous eyes like a beautiful woman's limbs, shyly covered in the years of desire,
suddenly enjoying nakedness, displaying its charms for the rejoicing eyes of the loving youth!
O Duke, you who know life and women, you sinned against Alviano, but he sinned even more against himself, because when I saw him, there, with my father, in all this splendour he created through the burning power of his mind,
when I saw him, the poorest, who himself tore the kind-hearted veils in which mercy wraps us as well as the strange power which tames the senses, then I remembered the saying of this unhappy one in his sole joyful hour:
""But if, on a glorious day,""
""in a bed of the loveliest flowers,""
""you were to find a grim monster...""
- For God's sake, young lady...
- Let me go, Duke!
Calm down then; the sole joyful hour, you said it yourself, he owes to you.
This may console you.
You shall not console me.
I do not want any mercy.
Torture and hatred I do deserve, desperation and death!
So listen to one last thing.
He was not worthy and did not deserve your love.
He is not the noble man you think he is.
He is obsessed by evil desire and today it befalls him... I won't hear anything.
You try to defame him, but he is noble and sublime and I am miserable and depraved.
I hate myself and the world and you.
Only the night... this very night I love and its shadows.
Then God may have mercy upon you.
Come now, I'll take you to your father.
Go, go!
But leave me here!
Ah, what a night!
What a glowing summer night!
I want to crawl into its dark light, dive into its shining darkness!
With stars I'll dance the summer night's dance, but with goblins I'll sleep in the bushes.
Ah, what a night!
What a glowing summer night!
Ah, what a night!
What a glowing summer night!
With stars I'll dance the summer night's dance, but with goblins I'll sleep in the bushes.
Ah, what a night!
What a glowing summer night!
Where is my bride?
Has no one seen Carlotta?
Why are you fleeing from me?
No, I am not fleeing from you.
You know me then?
I don't know who you are.
But if it were someone who loves you, beauty?
You love me?
Well then.
But let me peep at your face to see whether your eyes are bright or dull.
Are you Alviano?
No, you aren't.
Of nice build, a handsome man.
O beautiful Carlotta, how strangely you speak!
Strangely, my love?
Give me your hand, ah, it's soft and hot, and it feels pleasant.
Do you feel my heart beating passionately!
For you, my dear! For you!
But listen, young man, you hold it gently with your soft hands, you must not torment it, you clasp it, gently and softly.
- The night is short, dawn is close!
Come on, let us hurry!
- Sweet is the night,
- Feel my heart beating.
- Let us hurry, the night is short, dawn is close!
- For you!
- For you!
I hear her voice!
It resounds to me from heights and chasms a thousand times!
Singing from the air, a mocking song from the depths of hell!
Her figure dances before me, peers out of bushes, here and there her dress glitters like a will-o'-the-wisp she rushes me, uphill, downhill, into the air, into the swamps... and yet I held her, after all she was mine!
Or was she not?
- Vivat Alviano Salvago!
- He gave us joy!
Bearer of beauty!
Father of the people!
What do you want?
Be silent!
I am not a king.
A fool, a cripple!
A beggar, a monster!
Where is my bride?
Bring her to me!
I will be grateful.
I'll give you all my worldly goods.
Then I will be prince, king, god!
But give me Carlotta!
I will be grateful!
Then I will be prince, king, god!
Vivat Alviano, Apollo!
The Muses' friend!
Crown the king!
Where is the crown, the crown of rosaries?
This people's friend, lift him up!
Crown him with roses!
Cheers for Alviano!
Stop it, no, stop it...
Stop it, people of Genoa!
Stop it, beguiled people!
Madmen you are!
You crown the one who kidnapped your daughters, who seduced and abused your children, perhaps killed!
What is this?
What does he mean?
The Council of Eight!
Dreadful!
- He?
- Alviano?
!
- Don't believe him!
- l see!
- The Alberghi.
- The sly dogs!
- lt's done cleverly!
- These envious persons!
- Slander!
- Cheers for Alviano!
Be quiet!
Silence!
Listen to the Council of Eight!
Through the Holy Council of Eight, I, Duke Adorno, the people's protector and loyal friend, bring a charge against the knight Alviano Salvago.
I accuse him of kidnapping girls, of seduction and rape, committed against virgins, of procuring
- and encouragement to the same.
- Was there not a scream?
Did you not hear a scream?
By virtue of our power as judges and keepers of the law we extend the charge against the knight Alviano Salvago and accuse him who is possessed by the Evil One, who became a slave of Satan and wicked demons,
of having bewitched the people.
We cast a ban on the island Elysium.
It shall be devastated by fire, as a breeding ground of vices and devilish sin.
Sir Salvago, you...
You see, it comes down to this!
- They rob us!
- They grudge us the joy!
Cursed thieves!
Beasts!
- Down with Adorno!
- Death to the Alberghi!
Kill the bastards!
- lt's all a lie!
- Defend yourself!
- Alviano, speak!
- We believe you!
We stand by you!
Alviano, speak!
We protect you!
For you!
- Don't you hear it?
Music...
- Feel my heart beating.
The night is short, dawn is close.
Cymbals, flutes, harps... and wild singing?
You see, he is obsessed, the demon speaks through him!
Alviano, listen, it's a matter of life and death.
They will interrogate him under torture.
Lead him away!
Stop!
Do not touch him!
Him who is silent we trust more than you who speak.
He did us good.
If you want to arrest him, give us proof!
Proof!
Bring along that woman.
Take your veil off, Ginevra!
Ginevra Scotti!
For God's sake, let me go!
Speak frankly and without reserve, Ginevra Scotti.
Where were you hidden, before you fled to Duke Adorno, seeking help?
In the house of Alviano Salvago.
- Hear!
- Hear this!
- Silence!
Who is it?
- Hear this!
What are you waiting for?
Why don't you move?
Old man, have mercy and let me go!
I begin to realize, terribly clearly...
Speak frankly and without reserve, Signorina Scotti.
Who robbed you of freedom and honour?
A nobleman who called himself Menaldo Negroni.
- Ah!
The Alberghi!
- Look!
- Listen!
Yet, what about Salvago?
Spit out the truth!
Old man, she is in danger, I see the correlation before me!
The head of this gang of wild fellows, of noble robbers, is Alviano Salvago.
All this was brought before the Duke by Count Vitelozzo Tamare.
Who spoke the name?
Who snatched it from my brain?
It's him!
He kidnapped her.
He was after her.
He courted her. I know it, know it...
Are you raving?
Count Vitelozzo kidnapped Ginevra?
Who talks about Ginevra?
Who is she?
I don't know anything about her!
Carlotta!
You cur!
You rake!
You animal!
If I had hold of you, I'd tear you to pieces, you beast!
Come on, I'll lead you.
Do you see the blue light up there?
Do you hear?
Listen!
is this not music?
Wild and lascivious, screams and rejoicing...
People of Genoa!
I will lead you to your dishonoured daughters!
To my poor, lost bride!
Then I'll justify myself to you and you shall judge.
But woe to the others!
Woe!
Death upon them!
You lie!
You're wrong. I say the truth.
Listen, it might well be that she will not wake up any more,
that she will pass away into the other world.
And see, for me it meant so much.
I had nothing else.
In my whole life this woman was the only great, the only wonderful thing.
Realize, if you say to me:
""l kidnapped her, I took her by force,""
""l couldn't do otherwise because I loved her..."", then I must hate you, I must curse you since you took from a miserable one like me what he possessed, and you destroyed it.
But deep within me would still persist something, understand me, something like an aching consolation.
But if you say to me:
""She gave herself to me,""
""she, Carlotta, willingly, in love,""
""and she was happy,"" yes, precisely, you said ""happy"",
then, then... then I had nothing, well, then you took nothing from me, then I am once again as miserable... just as miserable as I was...
Thrown back into nothingness...
Even if you kill me, I know nothing else to tell you. Only one thing:
this woman became a slave to me from the first day I saw her, Alviano, according to your saying once,
""Beauty be prey of the strong.""
You fancied yourself strong, for one hour, but you were not.
Pleasure presented itself to you, there you avoided it, trembling and cowardly.
You only saw the darkness, the shadows, danger and sin.
Too bitterly branded for life you became by fate broken-winged, inhibited, self-conscious.
For your kind the precious flower is only living in dreams, but when she blossoms garishly and seducing by day it seems a dream to you, a vision, a nocturnal spectre.
For did not, Alviano, as you said, Carlotta also give herself to you?
Why did you not take her?
Because, because...
You devil, do not request that, before you go to hell, I reveal for all the world to see a crime
so ghastly...
Because I look into depths you can't even imagine, since I am a man and you?
I don't know which one of us is looking deeper.
I don't know what is to be rated higher:
a joyless life, a gradually wasting away or a death in rapture and transfiguration, in passionate embrace a blissful dying!
What happens to me?
Your words' meaning, but this is not possible...
Her lips asked for mercy, incoherently they stammered the old song of fearful resistance.
But her eyes begged for lust.
An agonizing confession escaped from her lips, fear and horror...
But from her eyes, boundless, wild, sparks of roused desire were flashing.
At last it forced its way:
greater than you, she made herself free.
The sparkling dance of her laughing eyes was joined by the inebriate song of her lips:
""Grant death,"" her eyes rejoiced,
- ""Grant happiness,"" craved her speech.
- Dreadful!
Wretch, knowingly you have...
Roll your eyes, bare your teeth and clench your fists!
My most blissful hour, no one can take it away from me!
Then say a prayer!
You're unable to get at me, what do you want?
At a parish fair a hunchbacked fiddler stroke up a graceful tune.
The most beautiful one of the beauties was his love.
I picked her out of the dancing crowd and took her away.
He rushed after me, he stood before me like this one, his features contorted, contorted and full of hate!
With his fiddle I killed him.
Come on then, with my hands I shall strangle all of you!
Then die, scoundrel!
Who was yelling there?
Was it not... my love?
No, no, look at me, Alviano...
Carlotta, beloved... I am with you, he lied, lied, lied!
Away, away!
A troll!
A nightmare!
Help!
Ugh, how heavy this bears!
And the red light!
Woe, woe!
Give me water.
No, give me wine.
And my love shall come, my handsome, sweet... I want Vitelozzo ere I die... I want, I want...
Yes, but where is the fiddle... At last I must go to the parish fair.
And my cap, my nice cap...
Red with silver bells.
Has no one seen the cap?
Leave me, I must at last...
Wait... what was that?
There is someone lying there...
Good people, there lies a dead man.
A presentation from a cultural and historical point of view in 7 chapters of moving pictures.
BENJAMIN CHRISTENSEN wrote the script and produced this film between the years of 1919 and 1921.
For the photography I am grateful to Mr. Johan Ankerstjerne and to Mr. Richard Louw for the art direction.
My main sources are mentioned in the theatre's playbill.
Let us look into the history of mysticism and try to explain the mysterious chapter known as the Witch.
The belief in sorcery and witchcraft is probably as old as mankind.
When primitive man is confronted with something incomprehensible, the explanation is always sorcery and evil spirits.
In Persia, the imaginary creatures depicted in the following picture were thus believed to be the cause of diseases.
The English scientist Rawlinson and French scientist Maspero show us pictures of evil spirits, believed to have resided amongst the first civilizations.
The belief in evil spirits, sorcery and witchcraft is the result of naive notions about the mystery of the universe.
Here we see how the Egyptians perceived the shape of the world (according to Maspero).
The ancient Egyptians believed that high mountains surrounded land and water on all sides.
The sky was made of steel and supported by strong pillars that stood on the high mountains.
The stars, like lamps, hung from the sky on ropes.
According to the beliefs of other ancient civilizations, the sky was vaulted and the earth shaped into terraces.
The evil spirits of ancient times changed in the medieval folklore to devils, sneaking around and tempting children.
The devils lived in the earth's core.
In the latter part of the Middle Ages the earth was considered to be a stationary sphere in the middle of the universe.
Above the earth and its waters -
- the medieval man first imagined a layer of air -
- then a layer of fire - - and outside the fire were the planets, moving celestial bodies.
Each planet was attached to its transparent, movable sphere.
And outside the planetary spheres were the fixed stars arranged in a sky of their own.
Above it all, in the tenth crystal sphere, sits the Almighty surrounded by nine choirs of angels and He is the One keeping the spheres revolving.
Deep down in the earth's core lies Hell, where those tempted by the Devil shall suffer forever.
In the upper part of the following picture
(from the French historian Lacroix) The devils are stuffing the damned into large pots.
A sinner is thrown straight into the fire burning under one of the cauldrons.
A devil pours the nasty sulfur oozing from a horn down a man's throat.
Two monsters torment some of the damned with their sharp teeth.
I have found a strange old mechanical presentation of Hell, which offers a good understanding of the beliefs in the Middle Ages.
Observe the eagerness with which the devils tend to the fire under the cauldrons!
During the Middle Ages, devils and Hell were considered real and constantly feared.
Witches were thought to have signed an unlawful pact with the Devil, and therefore they were burned at the stake.
The floating figure is a devil coming to get the witch by lifting her up into the air.
This picture of a pyre as well as the following one are from "German Life in the Past in Pictures."
In this image a witch is milking an ax handle.
In the following image a witch has bewitched a man's shoe.
Witches usually meet in councils.
And after the gathering they might, for instance, sneak into a barn and bewitch a cow.
The small angular symbol, noticeable under the drawing, was usually carved into the barn door as protection against witches.
In this old naive drawing, a sorcerer and a witch are casting spells, setting a village on fire.
Witches were believed to curse people with diseases with the help of sorcerer's powder and magic potions.
Notice how the sick person is laying naked in bed. That was habitual in the past.
It was a general belief that the witch was naked when, at night, during the so-called Witch Sabbath, she danced with the devils.
Women who wanted to participate in the "Sabbath" sneaked away to the sorcerer where they could have their backs smeared with "witch ointment".
The witchcraft of the ointment would allow them to fly through the air.
The French doctors Bourneville and Teinturier gave me the following pictures of the Witch Sabbath a secret satanic rite to which thousands of women asserted their participation.
At the Sabbath witches and sorcerers first desecrate the Church's holy cross.
Satan gives all the participants devils' names.
And a ceremonial banquet is held.
The Sabbath food was often prepared from corpses from the gallows.
All witches had to show the Devil their respect by kissing his behind.
After a merry dance with the devils, the witches fly home at the first crow of the cock.
These scenes are often found on famous Witch Sabbath pictures from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.
To be continued.
THE WITCH Chapter 2.
We go now to the underground home of a sorceress in the year of the Lord 1488.
"Tonight the stars shine favorably over the gallows' hill."
"Ugh, what a stench!
The thief's body has been hanging too long on the gallows."
"When such a thief's finger is too dried out, it can no longer lend the brew any healing power."
"Hurry and open up, Karna, so that the passers-by won't see me."
"Karna, can you perchance get me a love potion that has power over a pious man of the church?"
"Here, young maiden, take a potion of cat feces and dove hearts, boiled in the moonlight."
"A drop of this in a man's drink will soften his heart at once."
"Karna, can I have an even stronger potion?"
"If the maiden wishes to drive the man out of his wits for love..."
I have a potion boiled in May from a young and playful male sparrow."
"Hold your coin, maiden!
First smell my ointment!"
"This salve is good, should you wish to travel to Brocken, one night."
"Secretly smear this salve on and the pious monk might directly come to your chamber."
"You will fly together high up in the night and he will bestow upon you many hungry kisses."
"Listen Brother, I wonder...
shouldn't we pray before we embark in such a bold enterprise?"
"Oh Holy Mother, forgive us for cutting open a person's dead body with a knife!"
"It is not from untimely curiosity that we so badly sin..."
"...but so that the cause of many terrible diseases might be revealed to us."
"Help!
Hurry!
The peace of the cemetery has been desecrated by two witches."
Such were the Middle Ages, when witchcraft and the Devil's work were sought everywhere.
And that is why unusual things were believed to be true.
"Damned woman!
You shall not lie here and bewitch the legs of honest people."
"You watch out!
Now your filthy mouth shall remain open for eternity."
So it happens with witchcraft as with the Devil;
people's belief in him was so strong that he became real.
The Devil is everywhere and takes all shapes.
He shows himself as a nightmare, a raging demon, a seducer, a lover, and a knight.
The devils' companion can be young and beautiful, but she is more often old, poor and miserable.
Is it from the eternal fright of the pyre that you get drunk every night, you poor old woman of the Middle Ages?
When the evening bell tolls in the night and all fires in town are covered with ashes, the Devil fetches Apelone for his adventures.
High up in the air is Apelone's dream castle, and there the Devil will fulfill all her secret wishes.
To be continued
THE WITCH Chapter 3.
In "Rites and Rights in the German Past" by Franz Heinemann, we can observe pictures of inquisition judges at work.
A woman suspected of witchcraft is thrown into the water to find out whether she is guilty or not.
In "History of Customs", Edward Fuchs shows us how the accused is tied up.
Two executioners use oars to move the accused in the water where she has no support.
If she floats, she will be pulled up and burned.
If she sinks, the judges thank God for her innocence.
I will now illustrate a trial for witchcraft from beginning to end taking place at the time when the Pope sent traveling inquisition priests out to Germany.
"Oh, my husband could not have been struck by dizziness so suddenly, unless a sorceress had bewitched him!"
"Be comforted Anna, wife of the Printer, the power of lead will soon reveal it."
"Oh, you powerful Saturn, allow this lead to show if Jesper the Printer is bewitched."
"It is written here in the shape of lead that his dizziness is atrocious witchcraft."
"Oh Peter, look, where is the evil sorceress?"
"You might see that witch, before you wish to..."
"...before I wish to."
"Jesus' Holy Cross and Wounds!
I did not hear you come, Maria the Weaver!"
"Oh, maiden, please have mercy on me, a poor woman who has to go begging from door to door!"
"Are you hungry, Maria?
If so, sit down."
"Here, eat now, if you can, in the name of Jesus."
"Watch out, little sister, watch out.
That woman has evil eyes."
"The youngest servant of the inquisition may not exchange words with a strange maiden."
"How wonderful!
It felt like fire when the young maiden took my arm."
"Young maiden, you know quite well that what you're accusing this woman of, endangers her life?"
"Swear by the cross that you are not deadly enemies!"
"Let's go, young men, before her feet are lifted so that the evil witch won't turn us all into mice."
"Now you can have a scalding death, just what you deserve, you damned mistress of the Devil!"
To be continued
THE WITCH Chapter 4.
Two "honest" matrons will change the accused in jail, so that she will not wear hidden witch powder.
"Maria the Weaver was just taken here accused of witchcraft."
"Master, look carefully, there might be witch powder hidden in the sorceress' hair."
The suspect's nights are now dictated by the inquisition judges.
Two honorable men try amiably to persuade her to confess.
If she stubbornly denies her charges, they will use a kind of mental torture.
"Woman, see here the seven holy words of Jesus crucified, written on consecrated parchment."
"I will hang them around her neck, so that the Devil will no longer help her to be silent."
"Does she see this length of consecrated wax as Corpus Christi?"
The accused is taken backwards into the torture chamber, so as not to bewitch the judge when entering.
"For the last time I ask: Does she want to confess her witchcraft and her misdeeds?"
"Let her suffering begin so that we might put an end to the harshness of her heart."
"Oh, you learned men!
How do you expect me to confess to that which is not true?"
"Well, Rasmus the Executioner!
Let now the evil witch's body sting."
"Let her catch her breath, Rasmus the Executioner, and loosen the screw a little at a time, as she confesses her sins."
"Oh, learned men!
I confess that I've given birth to many children fathered by the Devil."
"And when I gave birth, Karna and all her coven helped me."
"If I am spared the pain, I will confess that Trina has smeared me with witch ointment."
"Oh yes, learned men, miserable me has flown through the night air to Brocken on Trina's broom."
"And the Devil's grandmother was there with all her witchcraft."
"And many a woman, who had not accomplished enough evil deeds, was treated miserably by the Devil."
"And masses spat upon all that is holy."
"And a meal of toads and unchristened children was cooked by Karna."
"Listen, Maria the Weaver, did you also see how the Devil put his mark on the witches' foreheads?"
"Oh, learned men, I saw the witches kiss the evil one on his behind."
"And Anna's mother, the wife of the Printer, who wished me a scalding death -"
"- that damned woman, I saw her kissing the evil one so tenderly... and Sissel, her servant, that old fool, was also there."
"And Elsa, who kicked me some time ago, she shall also burn at the stake."
"She passed Martin the Writer's door one moonlit night with her sister."
"And they cast a spell on Martin the Writer with the water they threw against his door."
"And it was the very same night that death took Martin the Writer."
"And now I will tell you everything about the witches, who yell after me in the street where I live."
To be continued
THE WITCH Chapter 5.
In this way begins the endless turn of the wheels during the witchcraft era.
Each witch gives ten others away.
The town wardens busy themselves.
If you oppose the capture of a witch, you must be a witch yourself.
The destiny of young Anna, wife of the Printer, is sealed.
So now only two people are left in Jesper the Printer's haunted house.
During the witchcraft era it was dangerous to be old and ugly, but it was not safe to be young and pretty either.
"Brother, help me. My thoughts are sinful."
"Bare your body, Brother!"
"I'll whip your sinful body and your poor soul, into faith healing."
"Oh Brother, why did you stop the beating of the scourge?
Now my soul will surely be damned."
"Father Henrik, Brother John is spellbound."
"A witch appears in his cell to tempt him."
"And she has grabbed him by the wrist."
"Stand up, Brother, Father Henrik is coming."
"Brother, you have not given the maiden away for a witch, have you?"
"You know the punishment for those who refuse to witness against a witch?"
And so they fetch you too, young maiden, giving you their unfailing test.
"In the name of the Holy Trinity, if you are not a witch, you will now shed tears!"
"See for yourself - you cannot shed tears, as you are allied with the evil one."
We assume now that the young woman resists; that no threat and no pain can persuade her to confess.
I have tried to find out how the excellent inquisition judges behaved in such circumstances.
And I see in front of me some scenes, which I do not find pictured too darkly here, on the white screen.
"Wake up, young maiden!
I bring you great happiness."
"See, young maiden, I give you your freedom   if you would just show me a small favor in return."
"Why do you taunt me, monk?
What favor can a poor creature like me show you?"
"Teach me the beautiful art of making thunder with this water!"
"If you do not want to take my word, young maiden, stand up and look out at the jail court."
"Did the guards leave?"
"Yes, they went far away, maiden.
The keys are now in my hand and I can secretly take you out through the town gates tonight."
"And I swear eternal silence to you, maiden, about all you will reveal about witchcraft with thunder."
"Do you remember, maiden, that Jesper, the Printer's child, is all alone in the world, without relatives besides you?"
"Oh, Father Henrik, see the tears of the young maiden.
Look, she cries, hence she cannot be a sorceress."
Don't you know that witches secretly smear themselves with spittle, so that we might believe it to be tears?"
"Here, maiden, see the child who will miserably perish as a dishonorable, rejected witch's offspring without you."
"Stand here and listen to all the maiden's words, so that later you may bear witness against her."
"And will you secretly open the jail gates for the child and me, if I speak?"
"Then I will tell you that once a traveling stone cutter told me..."
"...that when witches call for thunder, they put their hands in the water..."
"You hardened witch!
Before the sun is down tomorrow, you will burn alive at the stake."
"And then they will burn you too, maiden, "as edification for man, as sweet scent for God."
And one pyre after another burns in the town square, until the judges will one day move on to the next town.
The witch madness, like a spiritual plague, ravages wherever these judges go.
In the arc of a few centuries, over 8 million women, men and children were burned as witches.
To be continued
THE WITCH Chapter 6.
There are witch confessions that are totally insane.
Many women, for instance, confess that - transformed into cats - they soiled the altar during the night, while two devils in the shape of animals stood guard at the church door.
But there are also confessions, which might very well be close to the truth, namely during the times when superstition ruled.
Many women were burned because they confessed that they bewitched a marriage bed by "tying knots!"
For each knot a pregnancy is destroyed.
And the happiness of a whole house could be ruined with witch hair and metal crosses.
Many women have probably really used such magic tricks and believed in their destructive effects.
But, if we should judge from the confessions, we must take a closer look at the props in the torture chamber.
You and I would also be driven to confess mysterious talents with the help of such tools. Isn't that so?
The French doctor Paul Regnard describes the way this collar was used.
The collar was tightened with the help of four taut ropes.
The wrists and ankles of the accused were tied to two iron rods screwed to the floor.
When a fire bowl was put under the poor victim -
- his movements were so violent that the spikes of the collar entered his neck.
Doctor Regnard shows another picture, which speaks for itself.
It is simply called "After the interrogation."
The "painful interrogation" preferably began with a "lighter" torture:
The thumbscrew, for example.
One of my actresses insisted on trying the thumbscrew when we shot these pictures.
I will not reveal the terrible confessions I forced from the young lady in less than a minute.
In the convents during the Middle Ages, fear of the Devil escalated into an almost hopeless despair.
The pious gave themselves up to many a regrettable self-punishment.
Often a single nun was seized, and suddenly thereafter the whole convent was overtaken by insanity -
- a mysterious, contagious insanity.
In writings that have survived to this day, these unhappy women wrote down with touching simplicity how the Devil penetrated the convent.
"Get thee behind me, Satan!"
"May all good saints stand by me!
Sister Cecilia is conniving with the evil one."
How these religious women must have suffered, before their nerves abandoned them and insanity broke out?
In their biographies, this desperate cry is always found:
The devil forced us into it!
"Oh, Holy Mother, the evil has a terrible power!"
"Look, now he forces me into doing what I want the least."
"Burn me at the stake, pious fathers!
Can't you see what the Devil forces me to do?"
"Take me!
Don't you see him?
The evil one stands over there and threatens me."
To be continued
THE WITCH Chapter 7.
We pass over the Devil's actual possessions
(speaking in tongues and convulsions) And come to present times.
The majority of witches in the old days were poor women; those who are taken in by pious organizations and nursing homes nowadays.
One or more traits that might make an old woman noticeable was enough to bring her to court during the witchcraft era.
Let us not believe that the Devil belongs solely to the past.
The lovely old woman, who plays the role of Maria the Weaver in my film, once raised her tired face to me during a pause in the shoot -
- and said: "The Devil is real.
I have seen him sitting at my bedside."
With the old woman's permission, I show here the prayer book in which a woman (from 1921!
)
Thinks she can tell the Devil by sight.
The witch's insanity can be explained as a nervous exhaustion that I will try to exemplify here.
I ask my viewer to understand that in the following I let the same actress   portray many different patients of related nervous disorders.
I have personally known a very nervous young woman who often walked in her sleep.
Why did she always enact the very same thing she was most afraid she would do?
Like a witch forced by the devil, this woman   both when sleeping and awake - gives way to a mysterious craving to strike matches. Had this possession anything to do with her morbid fear of fire after one broke out in her home?
She stated that she felt as if she were fighting against an unknown force stronger than her own.
Isn't there something "witch-like" with this sleepwalker, who moves through the slumbering household with her matches?
Doesn't she remind us of the nun, who walks through the chapel with her knife, forced by the Devil?
This poor woman, also in a bewildered condition, does during her sleep just what she fears the most.
These possessions - these somnambulistic, dazed conditions - are consistent with the nervous diseases we call hysteria.
And there are still more connections between the medieval witch and the modern hysterical person.
We remember for instance that the witch received nightly visitations by the Devil.
Today it is not the Devil, but rather a famous actor, a popular clergyman or a well-known doctor, who disturbs the calm of the night.
The hysterical person will undoubtedly say that these celebrities come to her through the wall or window.
Notice how consciously this unconscious woman holds onto her bed.
A person afflicted by hysteria always displays some artificial mannerisms.
In the Middle Ages it was believed that during the Sabbath the Devil put some invisible marks on the witch's body, where all sensitivity vanished.
The executioner often found insensitive areas on the back of the accused.
"I see clearly that you are a witch.
You do not even feel the master's instrument on your back."
Today, this strange insensitivity is considered a symptom of hysteria.
"No sir, I do not feel you touching my back at all."
"Yes, it is as I thought; your daughter is suffering from hysteria."
"From what you told me, I must strongly recommend that we detain your daughter for the time being in my clinic."
"It would be a pity if your daughter were to have an unpleasant exchange with the police."
Poor little hysterical witch!
In the Middle Ages you were in conflict with the church.
Now it is with the law.
"I ask you to step into my office."
"Or do you prefer that I call the police?"
"Your name?
Do you have a card?"
"Your address?
Do you have a telephone in your home?"
"Thank you, that's fine.
You can leave.
I will contact you later."
"If my family learns about this, I will be forcefully detained."
"I beg you to understand that I am an unhappy, sick person.
I do not know what I am doing."
"I have not been able to live with this persistent fear during the war.
I am a broken person."
"It is as if an unknown power compels me to commit this terrible theft."
"Look here!
I just stole this little, expensively bound Russian book."
"What shall I do with it?
I do not know a word of Russian."
"My husband died in the war, and I have not been the same since..."
"I promise not to pursue this matter, but I have to ask you never to visit my store again."
Centuries have passed and the Almighty of medieval times no longer sits in his tenth sphere.
We no longer sit in church staring terrified at the frescoes of the devils.
The witch no longer flies away on her broom over the rooftops.
But isn't superstition still rampant among us?
Is there an obvious difference between the sorceress and her customer then and now?
We no longer burn our old and poor.
But do they not often suffer bitterly?
And the little woman, whom we call hysterical, alone and unhappy, isn't she still a riddle for us?
Nowadays we detain the unhappy in a mental institution or   if she is wealthy - in a modern clinic.
And then we will console ourselves with the notion that the mildly temperate shower of the clinic has replaced the barbaric methods of medieval times.
Nathan the Wise, only one copy has been found. It was found in Gosfilmofond, in Moscow, under the title "Conquest of Jerusalem." In 1997, the Munich Film Museum obtained a copy.
In 2006, following notes from the censors, the title was renamed and corrected,
And tints were restored according to the conventions of the 1920s. NATHAN THE WISE
Written by Hans Kyser, based on the play "Nathan the Wise" by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing.
Director, Manfred Noa Artistic advisor, Leo Pasetti
Do not make her pay because
I, for her belief, denied the faith of my fathers ...
In the hour of death, I ask you in the name of Jesus Christ to remember your promise to rear my dear son, Leu von Filneck, and give him the adopted name of
Curd von Stauffer. God will reward you. In the same way, have our newborn daughter baptized with the name of
Blanda and ...
The Saracen Saladin is approaching!
God protect our children, Leu and Blanda. Assad von Filneck
The grace of Allah let us find this picture of your missing brother, who Prince Assad has long sought.
God protect our children, Leu and Blanda. Assad von Filneck
Bury my brother's wife with all royal honors!
Whoever finds it is a friend of Saladin!
The defeated Crusaders used their weapons to go looting from town to town.
Nathan with his sons.
Outside there is killing and looting!
To arms!
The Lord is our shepherd ...
We are all under the protection of the Almighty!
My children!
And Nathan fell down on his face for three days and three nights before God and cried ...
Nathan and lashed out at God and cursed men ...
Save this child of the Saracens!
Have you seen a horseman with a child?
You took my 7 children, God.
Then you returned one to me!
Praised be thy name!
The religious wars of the fanatics burned from morning to night
The war fanned from east and west among the people.
After besieging Jerusalem for months, Saladin gave the order to attack.
The Holy Sepulcher calls you into the final battle. Do not forget that Saladin has sworn to put to death every Templar Knight.
With the capture of the castle of the Templars he had broken their last resistance.
The Jerusalem Christians remained at the mercy of the victor.
[Decree] We, Sultan Jussuf-ben-Eijub Saladino, Savior of the faith, take Jerusalem into our domain.
Whoever took up arms against us may pay a ransom of ten pieces of gold, to enjoy freedom, along with his wife and children, and all their property. Whoever does not do so, is in our hands.
There will be no leniency for the Knights Templar, who will suffer at our nefarious ends.
We guarantee to the Christian Patriarch of Jerusalem the right to deliver justice hereinafter on Christians remaining in the city, according to civil and canonical law.
Who sows blood harvests iron.
In Jerusalem, Islam triumphed.
Christian Warriors could redeem in gold, and escape the horrible fate of slavery. Recha.
Father is going to redeem these poor slaves!
Nathan, you are like Christ!
To the Templars, the captives had one sentence.
Princess Sittah, sister of Saladin
I want to die as a Knight and a Christian!
What is your name, knight?
Take the others to the citadel.
God protect our children, Leu and Blanda.
Assad von Filneck
And Recha thought of her father's prayers in the past.
Fire!
Recha is in the house! Save her! Save her!
Father, my father!
Saladin!
You give me life. Thank you for my life!
For quite a while Recha had had
Thoughts about her wonderful salvation filled with fearful dreams.
I have seen him again, my guardian angel, and he told me to give thanks to God.
I don't want to have anything to do with you and yours!
Where is Recha?
It would be easy for a few valiant men To take Saladin's life ... so says the Patriarch
Think of your brothers, the Templar captives ... so says the Patriarch
I owe Saladin my life! Should I take his? Never!
Al-Hafi, a dervish.
I saw an angel, face to face.
She still longs for him!
Her savior was a Templar knight pardoned by Saladin.
Go, invite all the poor to celebrate with me A feast of thanksgiving!
Who is the party for?
For your angel, Recha!
Nathan cordially invites you ...
To a feast -- music, dance and Recha await you!
He said he would not come to the home of a Jew!
Even though Saladin's coffers were empty,
He continued to feed the poor.
You dole out miserably!
Only a beggar knows how to feed a beggar. Change clothes with him!
He is not to blame!
Nathan is giving a feast for the poor!
Is he so rich?
Bring the Jew here!
He shall fill my empty coffers!
Give me this coat for Recha.
She wants to go down on her knee to thank her savior.
Nathan, I am ashamed You misunderstood me a moment ago.
Saladin orders you to come right away ...
He threatens disaster otherwise!
Hasn't he pardoned you, and though you Pardoned me seven times over?
What if I love him?
My heart has a strange peacefulness!
New Crusaders have landed in Akkon. Prepare the standard of the prophet!
Nathan has appeared ...
Bringing pots of coins to the treasure chamber. Bring the three greatest!
Let me return to my desert!
I am afraid I will forget how to be a man as long as I am here!
The true king is really a beggar!
Your name is Nathan? Nathan the Wise?
You are a Jew, I am a Muslim, and Christ is among us. Give me proof of your reputation:
Of these three religions only one may be true!
Decide, oh wise one!
Princess Sittah, Restore Nathan to us!
How much is Nathan worth?
A ring?
Nice rock!
How do I say?
The poor call him the tears of God!
Before I answer your question about the true religion, May I tell you a story?
A man once lived in the far east and possessed a valuable ring ...
The stone ring had a secret power of ... making someone at peace with God and man ...
So he left the ring to his beloved son and decided that it should be passed on   over the course of generations, it came to the father of three sons  For him, each was as beloved
In order not to offend any of his children, The father created two other rings, each exactly alike, and gave one to each child in secret and blessed them
Just as the father was dying, the children arrived, each with his ring, to claim the estate.
More tests were made, but they failed to find the authentic ring. As the true faith ...
So the brothers went to court, swearing to the judge that each had received the true ring from his father ...
The wise judge said, "The real ring has the power to make men at peace
That must be decisive ... "
"Check each one and the power of his ring in the spirit of noble competition." "Whoever holds the highest good:
love of mankind!"
"Has the true ring!"
Therefore, the Sultan, whoever acted on the words of that wise judge, Has the true religion!
The ransom of the poor for the rich!
Give me the ring!
Every time I see true love of mankind, without prejudice, I will remember what God gave me!
FOURTH ACT.
These are troubled times.
My money would be more secure with you ...
Let me thank you! and the life of the young Templar!
God protect our children, Leu and Blanda, Assad von Filneck
The time has come for the truth! We're ready!
Look for a reason to strike!
Do you love the Templar?
I do not know, Father!
I put aside the uniform that separates us! Give me Recha as a wife!
I cannot give her to you! Have patience!
A Jew is always a Jew!
So listen, Knight: Recha is not Jewish. She is a Christian and Nathan is not her father!
Take me to the Patriarch!
Free your conscience and mine!
Give Recha to the Templar as his wife!
Hurry! Take these treasures to Saladin!
Nathan the Jew has a Christian child despite his beliefs.
I, Curd von Stauffer, Knight of the Order of the Templars, have a claim against Nathan the Jew. ..
According to the rights under our Charter, we demand that Sultan Saladin Deliver Nathan to our courts, to be judged according to civil and canonical law! Judge him truly!
Recha!
Recha!
For your salvation, Recha:
You were born a Christian and Nathan is not your father!
What brings you here, my young friend, you who are a faithful likeness to Assad?
Before you, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, appears the noble Curd von Stauffer,
Knight of the Order of the Templars, who has made a claim before this assembly against the Jew, Nathan  and Nathan gave all this money for your life.
According to the rights under our Charter ...
You must now make you own way to the end of this matter.
You yourself must put Nathan in prison.
My Father, nobody is going to separate us!
According to our Charter rights, which Saladin granted us after the capture of the city, anyone who has a claim against a Jew may have the Patriarch judge him according to civil and canonical law.
If we are wrong, forgive us for our love!
FIFTH ACT.
War, Saladin? Remember the ring!
Sentencing according to civil an canonical law:
The Jew will be burned   and his purported daughter will be sent to a convent.
I once served as a squire to a knight.
Read his last message!
[Letter] Konrad von Filneck to Assad, Duke of Schwabia,
In the hour of death, I ask you in the name of Jesus Christ to remember your promise to rear my dear son, Leu von Filneck, ...
The knight, Leu von Filneck, asks for an audience!
Clemency for Nathan!
My life in exchange for his!
In what name do you ask for clemency?
[Letter] Konrad von Filneck to Assad, Duke of Schwabia,
And that you rear my dear son, Leu von Filneck, who is with you at this time, and , to rear my dear son, Leu von Filneck, ... and give him the adopted name of Curd von Stauffer.
And that God will reward you.
In the same way, we get a daughter of the holy baptism Blanda's name and that ...
Have mercy on my father!
Take him to the prison with the other Templars, and take this girl to Nathan!
Have confidence in me!
Does not your ring teach you to be at peace with God and man?
SIXTH ACT.
The Patriarch's message: As expected, Saladin has broken his word.
Return immediately to Jerusalem!
The Templar Knights are marching on Jerusalem!
The Patriarch asked the Sultan Saladin To put his stamp on the decision of the ecclesiastical court!
Invite the Patriarch and his entourage tomorrow To attend the execution of the sentence in the citadel!
The day of the trial.
Sultan Saladin asks you to attend the execution of the sentence At the citadel.
He will give you a hostage For every man that goes to Jerusalem.
Prepare to receive your judgment!
My word requires me to pronounce a terrible sentence upon you.
If I do not, these walls will be stained with blood tomorrow.
War or Peace:
You yourself pronounce the judgment!
It is better for one man to die than all of humanity to be stricken with more hate and guilt.
I'm ready!
Nathan, the child that you reared in noble humanity has not been baptized.
Your sublime example has shown us all the path of true wisdom and love of our neighbor. You're free!
The people shall live in the future in peace and harmony with one another.
That's why we give freedom to the captive Templars!
No more religious hatred shall separate the peoples of east and west.
We thus transfer solemnly to Christianity the tomb of their Redeemer as a place of eternal pilgrimage.
Blanda Von Filneck, you are my brother's daughter!
Leu von Filneck, now comes the hardest test of your heart:

Your people submit!
Your people are of different religions, habits and opinions, Support them and help them!

Chronicle of the Great Death in Wisborg anno Domini 1838, by...
NOSFERATU
Does this word not sound to you like the midnight cry of the Deathbird.
Take care in saying it, lest life's images fade into shadows, and ghostly dreams rise from your heart and nourish themselves on your blood.
Long have I contemplated the origin and recession of the Great Death in my hometown of Wisborg.
Here is its story:
There lived in Wisborg Hutter and his young wife Ellen
Why did you kill them... the lovely flowers...?
Not so fast, my young friend!
No-one outruns his destiny.
There was also a property agent by the name of Knock- the subject of all sorts of rumours.
One thing was certain: he paid his people well
Count Orlok
- His Lordship... from Transylvania... wishes to acquire a beautiful home in our little town...
You could earn a nice bit of money of course the price is a little effort... some sweat and perhaps... a little blood...
He wants a fine, deserted house...
That house... directly across from yours.
Offer him that one!
Travel quickly, travel well, my young friend, into the land of the spectres.
I'm travelling far, far away into the land of thieves and spectres.
So Hutter placed the anguished girl in the care of his friends, the rich shipowner Harding and his sister
Be at ease.
and young Hutter travelled many dusty roads, but at last the peaks of the Carpathians loomed before him.
The horses strained harder
Quickly... something to eat -
I have to get to Count Orlok's castle!
You shouldn't go any further now;
the Werewolf roams the woods.
Of Vampyres Gastlie Spirits, Bewitchments and the Seven Deadlie Sins
From Belial's seed sprang the vampyre NOSFERATU, who doth live and feed on the bloode of humankind - Beyonde deliverance he doth dwell in gastlie caves, sepulchres and coffins, filled so with god-curst earth from the fields of the Black Death
Of Vampyres Gastlie Spirits, Bewitchments and the Seven Deadlie Sins
Onward!
The sun is setting!
Offer what you like! We're not going any further!
We won't go on!
It's frightening beyond the pass!
No sooner had Hutter stepped across the bridge, than the eerie visions he had often told me about seized hold of him.
You have kept me waiting - waiting too long. -
Now it is nearly midnight.
The servants are sleeping!
End of the 1st Act.
Nosferatu 2nd Act.
You have hurt yourself...
Precious blood!
Shouldn't we like to sit together a bit, dear friend?
It is a while still till sunrise - and in the daytime I sleep, my dear fellow, I sleep the deepest of sleeps -
Just as the sun rose, the shadows of the night withdrew from Hutter as well
My dear!
My dearest!
Grieve not that thy beloved is so far away
I am plagued by mosquitoes.
I already have two bites on my throat, one quite near the other, on each side
One dreams so heavily in this desolate castle, but fear not.
The spectral evening light seemed to revive the shadows of the castle once more
Your wife has a lovely neck...
I shall buy the house...
The fine, deserted house opposite yours...
At night this same Nosferatu doth clutch his victim and doth suck like hellish life-potion its blood.
Take heede that his shadow not encumber thee like an incubus with gruesome dreams
At the same hour.
A doctor... a doctor!
Harmless congestions of the blood.
The doctor related Ellen's distress to me as an unknown illness.
I know, however, that her soul that night caught the cry of the Deathbird -
Nosferatu was already spreading his wings. -
Yet with the morning light Hutter set out to make sense of the horror of his nights. -
The raftsmen didn't know what kind of unholy cargo they were conveying through the dale.
End of the 2nd Act.
Nosferatu 3rd Act.
He was brought to the hospital yesterday by some farmers.
They said he must have fallen.
He's still feverish...
Nosferatu was on his way. The danger for Wisborg drew nigh.
The Paracelsian Professor Bulwer, who at that time was studying the secrets of nature and their deepest unifying principles, told me the following:
Earth-filled coffins were to be loaded onto the double-masted ship, the Empusa
The vessel's still set for sail tonight.
Bill of Lading:
EMPUSA
Route: from GALAZ to WISBORG
Cargo: 6 crates of earth (experimental purposes)
In those days, I should note, Prof. Bulwer was explaining to his students the cruel habits of carnivorous plants.
They observed in horror nature's mysterious ways.
Like a vampire - isn't it?
It seems that the approach of the strangler, Nosferatu, already compelled the property agent Knock into his shadow.
The patient admitted yesterday is going mad...
Blood is life!
Blood is life!
And this one here a polyp with tentacles transparent...
almost incorporeal almost but a phantom...
Ellen was often seen on the beach within the solitude of the dunes. Yearning for her beloved, her eyes scanned waves and distance alike.
My dear!
My dearest!
Grieve not that thy beloved is so far away
I am plagued by mosquitoes.
I already have two bites on my throat, one quite near the other, on each side
One dreams so heavily in this desolate castle, but fear not.
No I must go...
by the shortest route home!
A plague epidemic has broken out in Transylvania and the Black Sea ports of Varna and Galaz.
All victims exhibit the same peculiar stigmata on the neck, the origin of which still puzzles the doctors.
The Dardanelles were closed to all ships suspected of carrying the plague.
A sailor's fallen ill below deck.
He's delirious.
It spread through the ship like an epidemic.
The first stricken sailor pulled the entire crew after him into the dark grave of the waves.
In the light of the sinking sun, the captain and ship's mate bid farewell to the last of their comrades.
I'm going below!
If I'm not back up in ten minutes...
The ship of death had acquired its new captain.
End of the 3rd Act.
Nosferatu 4th Act.
It's quite difficult to say how, despite his depleted strength, young Hutter succeeded in surmounting the obstacles on his voyage home - - meanwhile, Nosferatu's deadly breath swelled the sails of the ship, which flew on toward its destination with ghostly haste.
I must go to him.
He's coming!
The master is near...
The master is near...!
Long have I pondered why Nosferatu was said to have travelled with earth-filled coffins.
I found it recorded that vampyres can only draw their shadowy strength from the accursed earth in which they were buried.
Thank God... you're safe...
All's well now...
Looked over everything...
Not a living soul on board.
Varna - 12 July
Crew - minus myself as captain: one helmsman; one ship's mate;
Second day - 13 July one sailor ill with fever
Course:
SSW Wind:
NE
Third day - 14 July ship's mate is babbling claims strange passenger is below deck
Course:
SE Wind:
NE
Tenth day - 22 July rats in ship's hold danger of plague
Danger of plague!
Go home!
Shut all windows and doors!
PROCLAMATION
It is hereby decreed that the honourable magistrate of this town forbids the populace to transport the ill or plague-stricken to the hospital, lest the plague spread through the streets.
End ofthe 4th Act.
Nosferatu 5th Act.
Hutter made Ellen swear not to touch the book which had frightened him with its visions. -
Yet she could not resist its bizarre attraction.
At night this same Nosferatu doth clutch his victim and doth suck like hellish life-potion its blood.
Take heede that his shadow not encumber thee like an incubus with gruesome dreams
Wherefore no other salvation is possible, but that a maiden wholly without sin maketh the Vampyre forget the first crow of the cock. Would that she give freely of her blood
This is what I see - each evening...!
Fear lurked in every corner of the town.
Who was still well?
Who already ill?
I'll run over there quickly...
I'll fetch Sievers...
Wherefore no other salvation is possible, but that a maiden wholly without sin maketh the Vampyre forget the first crow of the cock. Would that she give freely of her blood
The panic-stricken town was looking for a victim:
it was Knock.
Someone saw him!
He ran outside!
He strangled the custodian...
He strangled him...
the vampire!
I LOVE YOU
Bulwer!
Fetch Bulwer!
Knock has been captured!
The master... the master...!
The master... is... dead.
witness the miracle on the heels of the truth:
at that very hour, the Great Death came to an end, and as if confronted by the victorious radiance of the living sun, the shadow of the Deathbird was dispersed.

FIRST ACT.
What were you just thinking about, Lorenz?
About my former life...!
Write the story of your life in this book, which Father himself bound for you!
Do you think the memory will be less agonising then?
I, former convict Lorenz Lubota, hereby write down, as my dear wife Marie wills it so, the story of my guilt and my atonement.
Melanie doesn't have any time for this - does she?
Call Lorenz!
Always you with your books, Lorenz!
With the amount of money you earn even God doesn't know how you could be able to afford them!
Just let me have my poor books, Mother.
At the very least they provide one with dreams of all the things one will never experience...
Isn't it time for you to get to art-school, Hugo?
I'll be coming home a bit later today.
I want to help Aunt Schwabe with some accounts.
I don't want you to have anything to do with her - with that... usurious witch!
She's gotten fat and rich off her cutthroat business!
And I, I've slaved away my whole life like a horse...
The neighbours.
Lorenz should be getting here soon, at this point.
It seems to me, my child, that you divide your day up into Lorenz's comings and goings!
Does Lorenz know that? !
...hold onto your heart, Marie!
Once Lorenz wakes up from his dream world...
Here are a few poems I've done, Father Starke...
I'd like to hear what you think of them...
Well well, now you of all people are wishing to tread among the poets - ?
Please, don't hold me up!
I have to go to work!
What kind of work is it that you do anyway - ?
Where did you get those silky rags? !
Where have you been running around night after night - ? !
Get a grip on yourself, Mother!
You're rid of me now - !
I have no desire to wither away and rot in this miserable hole!
I can stand on my own two feet!
I don't need anybody's help!
Misery, hunger, poverty - everything's coming down on me!
And now disgrace too!
Can't Lorenz Lubota ever get to work on time? !
The good Lord in a fit of wrath made Lorenz Lubota town clerk!
Well - take care, Mother!
Melanie... where you're headed... there's no way back...
What do you want here?
Why are you running after our dear girl?
END OF THE FIRST ACT.
SECOND ACT.
So, I'm telling you, Marie...
This Lorenz, who would have thought of it!
This is more than talent - this is genius!
Mist - Mister Lubota!
Professor, old Starke doesn't just throw his support behind anyone, but Lorenz Lubota - that's a genius!
Are you the one, Muse, / Who takes me in her service, /
And like the Sphinx / Tears with her claws from my breast /
My song?
Lorenz!
Are you ill? !
Have you already found out - ?
From your sister - ?
How ugly... how terribly ugly it all is - !
I want to go get a little fresh air...
maybe - that will put me more at ease...
You, sir - man - lad, do you know you're a genius? !
I gave your poems to a man who would consider it an honour to be your mentor.
One fine day, at the hall where you were once a lowly clerk, you'll be made an honorary citizen of our town!
Do you really think... that I'm a poet...?
That I could be a great and eminent man - ? !
I think that now the boy realises he's a poet, he's losing his head!
What's the name of the daughter in this house here?
I can't give you anything more, child...
I've got nothing myself...!
Either the money - or the pawn-ticket!
Rules are rules in this world!
This must be your first experience with Schwabe... as you think you can persuade the old bird by pleading?
You know Mr Wigottschinsky, Lorenz - don't you?
Pretend I'm not here;
act like you would in your own home!
I gave a number of poems that I composed in my spare time to an excellent judge of literature - a certain Mr. Starke, to read...
Now he wants to introduce me to a well-known publisher who's supposed to print my poems...
My boy, you might very well become quite the famous man.
How can an old hand such as you be so far off the mark in your judgment!
The poems are nice enough... but they are certainly not, and never will be, publishable material - !
Now I don't dare go to the publisher... with my shabby suit...
Considering your impending fame, you do look pretty shabby...
We'll just have to help fix that for you...
The old dame seems to have taken a fancy to you.
It's usually hard to pull one over on her!
I think I'll accompany our poet to look for some new clothes.
I'm something of an expert there!
Will you come back again?
