i can only lead you to the truth
i can 't make you believe it
she 's calling herself jolene parker
elizabeth keen is not your wife , she 's your target
you 've been threatening to tell me the truth about my husband
since the day we met. and i 'm ready to listen
right now , the only thing that matters is the immediate threat , your husband
finding out who he is and who he works for
the rest will come
i promise you
asset on board. en route
12 cc 's epinephrine
clear
45 seconds
we need more adrenaline
cover her mouth
it 's okay
you 're okay
you 're okay
we 're taking you to washington dc
do you know where the prisoner was transported to
ah , washington. okay
yeah , we 'll take care of it
very good
since when did jolene parker 's case go from missing person to murder investigation ? and have you seen my keys
crazy , right ? yeah
what , uh
what happened
police say they have a person of interest
really
who is it
what do they know
they 're not sure
isn 't it possible that she just left town ? like she said , move to dayton
they found blood
matches hers
you see this stuff every day
you know , people getting hurt and killed
and i don 't , and it freaks me out
just the thought of that happening to you , you know
just promise me you 're as careful as you can be when you 're at work
the desk. by the computer
that 's where i saw your keys
i 'm gonna be so late
i 'm going to give myself a tardy slip
found ' em
they were under the newspaper
what would i do without you ? i gotta run
uh , tonight , for dinner
let 's check out that new thai place
he knows something 's off
what makes you say that ? i can feel it
i know him
tom is on his heels
he 's behaving erratically
he killed jolene parker
you knew
why didn 't you tell me
i felt if i told you it would inform your behavior with him
i found her body , called the police and reported a missing person. i was confident that in the course of their investigation
they would reach out to you and tom. and they did
jolene parker undoubtedly worked for the same organization as tom
in what capacity , i have no idea
if they worked together why would he murder her
perhaps he was ordered to
or perhaps he 's just out of control , irrational
paranoid and reactionary
he 's scrambling for a foothold. and therein lies our opportunity , to wait and to watch
but tom is not the reason i 'm here
i 'm afraid there 's something quite timely afoot
the pavlovich brothers are back in town
you 're talking about the team from the bridge that grabbed the general 's daughter. they 're an extraction team
cut their teeth on milosevic 's protective detail
during the ethnic cleansing of the yugoslav wars
we lost six of our men that day
to the best of our knowledge , the pavlovich brothers have no political agenda
they specialize in snatch-and-grabs ranging from kidnap and ransom to extracting political dissidents
reddington says he has a contact , a money launderer sourced by the brothers
claims they 're coming after a chinese scientist named xiaoping li
what do we know about her
eighteen hours ago the agency sent an undercover team to extract her from a clandestine labor camp in the yunnan province. break her out
why
she 's an immunologist
specializes in viral and bacterial diseases
four months ago she signaled to one of our assets that she had a willingness to talk about a secret weapons program
a month later she was jailed for treason. she 's scheduled to land at andrews in under an hour
we have a team standing by to escort her to langley for a debriefing
we gotta assume that the pavlovich brothers already know the route
well , then we 'll re-route her. bring her here
coordinate the adjustment with langley
this way
what 's going on
they said i 'd be safe once i arrived
we have a credible threat you 're being targeted
as a precaution , we 've altered our route
get up to the chopper
donald ressler. fbi
where 's the asset
ground transport 's been arranged. negative
evac 's been compromised
moving to beta protocol
call it in
all right. okay , copy that
anne arundel county sheriff 's department is reporting a downed aircraft burning two miles outside of crofton
there 's no witnesses on the ground
we do have units en route
it 's gotta be the dump site on this chopper
they knew cia protocol
that if he routes were compromised they 'd send in air support
they snuck in and they 're gonna sneak out
we should coordinate with homeland , get their faces everywhere
agent malik , you want to tell me why the director of national intelligence is calling
what don 't i know about this case
the program li was working on , it 's germ weaponry
banned by nearly every nation on earth
it 's called whitefog
the day before she was jailed , xiaoping li sent a message indicating that she had access to the designs
if she did , and she shared those with us , that would represent the biggest intelligence coup in a decade
a germ warfare program
that 's why the chinese can 't turn this into an international incident
where are you ? busy
the brothers
they took xiaoping li
how do you know
do you have a lead
something we can
your husband is not in school. wait
where is he
meet me at 9th and constitution
reddington says he has a lead on the brothers
wants to talk
let me know what ntsb says about that downed aircraft
he called in sick this morning
returned home briefly before making a stop at the radford bank in adams-morgan
he 's made three phone calls , all from pay phones
he 's been sitting at that cart for nearly an hour
i 'm sorry , lizzy
don 't be
this must be difficult
you wanna know what 's hard
sitting here when all i really want to do is get my hands around his throat
shouldn 't we follow him
we are
they all work for you
lizzy
wait
not now
the boat
how long for the boat
no
no. please
tom ? i 'm in the dining room
where did you get that thing
i was gonna ask you the same question
found it in the basement
that 's where that was
i 'd been looking for it
my father gave it to me
it 's beautiful
it 's in great condition , too
looks almost new
why haven 't i seen this before
your pot is gonna boil over
yeah , well , i just thought it might be nice , you know
to stay home alone
how was your day
it was exhausting
you know billy salter , he was acting up again
cause his mom keeps packing these fruit roll ups and they give him this satanic sugar high , you know , so
oh. i did stop by the national archives. just to maybe book a field trip for the kids
its funny , i , uh
i could have sworn that i saw you there
there was a woman there and she looked just like you
ah. no , i wish
i was cooped up in the office all day
should have known
well , whoever she was , she could not have been half as beautiful as you are right now
i 'm gonna walk the dog
come here. hey , hey , hey
where you going
come here. come here
yes , you 're a good boy. yes , you are
yes , you are
what
nothing
love you
i 'll be right back
come on , bud
come on
come on
who 's a good boy
you 're a good boy. yeah , yeah , yeah
how may i direct your call
hi , i 'm having a problem with my account
number 's delta , sierra , four , five , one
proceed. mockingbird knows
requesting immediate evac
she knows
he 's gone
my husband is gone
your husband never existed
lizzy , i understand why you went after tom today
the instinct to jump in is
but it isn 't going to serve you well here
and from the emotional point of view this must feel like an extraordinary violation and betrayal
but for tom it was business
do you know we had sex the other night
do you have any idea how filthy that makes me feel ? unfortunately , lizzy , you 're chest deep in filth
and you are going to have to wade through it to get to the other side
i fell in love with him
i married him
we were going to have
i was excited to have a child with him
he was the one person i chose in my life who made me happy. who made me feel safe
what does that say about me
everything we had was just a figment of my imagination
worse than a figment. a lie
it was right in front of my face and i didn 't see it
i just
believed it
all of it
time is the only thing that will allow you to find yourself again
if you tell me to be patient one more time , i swear to god ... i 'm going to find him. i 'm gonna find answers
the case
i need a lead
lizzy , if you want to find where the pavlovich brothers are , you need to find out where they 've been
the helicopter is key
the pavlovich brothers burned that chopper to cover up evidence
fingerprints
those things might have identified the brothers , but what about the chopper
the tail numbers were falsified and the chopper was re-painted. that 's what they did , but where did they do it
is there a deeper forensic analysis we can run
what particulates were in the heat exchange
was there moisture in the compressor
i 'll reach out to forensics
analyze every drop of fuel , track every grain of sand
i want to know where that chopper 's been
that 's him
sorry , man , not for hire
hello , symir
i 'll be brief and to the point
yesterday you had a customer , picked him up outside the national archives
sorry , man
oh , symir
you should have taken the money
your passenger
where 'd you drop him
ah , calculus
i can 't even think about derivatives without thinking of that tutor in manor hall
cindy something-or-other
never wore a brassiere
always a bounce in her step
look , i 'm talking. cooperating
you don 't need to copy my driver 's license , my credit cards
we want to make sure we know where to reach you , geoffrey p
seevers. should we have more questions
so , tell me about the book
i told you , i pick up and drop off
i don 't know names
i 'm the messenger
what is it , some kind of code
how many times have you done this
these drops
this was the fourth
i need you to write down the location of each drop you 've made
the pick-up and the drop location
oh , my god
pagosa springs public library
i had a water pump go out in pagosa springs
bitch of a mountain , wolf creek pass
thought i was going to end up living out there with the hill people until this teddy bear of a man fixed me up at the local garage
i 'll never forget him
tracy woods
you don 't know tracy , do you
leather vest
mustache
tracy woods
i wonder if he 's still fixing water pumps
anyway , it will always be a fond memory
the list
so that 's it
we 're
what about the package
you are going to deliver it. or return it. or whatever the people you work for want you to do with it
and as far as you 're concerned , we never had this conversation
dembe. a copy , please
i hope you have nothing pressing , this may take a minute or three
you 're sure you don 't know him
leather vest. mustache
tracy woods
shame
i got something
okay , i never wanted to know this much about gas chromotography or gear lubricants , but i think mr
reddington is onto something
look at this
we pulled the lab reports from the ntsb and the chopper 's engine tested positive for two distinct compounds
the first is ethephon. which is a ripening agent for tobacco
and how does that help us
take a look
tobacco production 's way down in this area
in fact , since 1998 , the federal government is actually paying farmers not to grow it
okay , but there are still plenty of tobacco farms
i agree. which brings us to chemical compound number two
this one is used to grow sweet corn
so we cross reference the two ? exactly
who used to supply tobacco growers , but made the transition to corn
and how many of those are there
seventeen
of those , 11 are outside of the fuel range of this chopper
of the other six , only one has a structure large enough to get that stolen helicopter out of view and under construction
halifax agro-chem
if i had to bet , i 'd say that 's their staging site
it 's around the corner , half a block up
i make seven exterior cameras. those are the ones they want us to see
and it 's on the list of drop sites i gave you
how long has mr
keen been inside
i tailed him here four hours ago
lovely
thank you , preston
you want me to call sabusawa
that would be ideal. but he 's working an extraction in ecuador
then how do you plan on getting keen out of that concrete box
we have a lead on xiaoping li
excellent. tell me
we think she 's being held at halifax agro-chem in falls church
we 're assembling a team
i don 't want to talk about tom with you
you have your opinion on how to proceed and i have mine
just don 't bother yourself , i 'll deal with tom
lizzy , i assure you that will yield no answers and little satisfaction
well , i 'll find out won 't i
i wish i could talk you out of this
you can 't
well , good luck with xiaoping
good afternoon , gentlemen
i 'm raymond reddington
go
move , move , move
we 're moving to the cars
or an atomic number. something from a periodic table
why do you think that
because the only word i know that contains
the letters "; vg "; together is avgolemono. i don 't know what that is. it 's a soup
chicken stock , egg yolks and lemon juice
point is maybe xiaoping li left us a message
i 'll run the letter combination against the dmv registry
see if we get a hit. any luck
i can 't get ahold of reddington
you told him the location where the brothers were holding xiaoping li , right
don 't you find it a hell of a coincidence
that we show up there , they 're gone , and now we can 't get ahold of reddington ? we 've been played
red put us onto the pavlovich brothers
where are you going ? i 'm going to find reddington
get some answers
reddington , i need you to call me , please. i need some help with the case
a gift from reddington. enjoy
wasted. two years we 've spent
on what
do you care at all about what you 've done to me
what you 've done to my life
what has it done to you ? who could do such a thing
finding you , stopping you
you think i 'd get some satisfaction out of that
no sentence , no punishment , no revenge could ever come close to making up for what you 've done. i was doing my job
your job
that was our life
we were going to have a baby
you begged me to have a baby
i was doing my job
stop talking about your job
everything was a lie
my life was a lie. every feeling
every memory
say something to your wife who is dying in front of you
say something
it was the shoes
what does that mean
that 's when i knew
it was those brown leather shoes
it was our third or maybe fourth date
you 'd come over to my place on halstead and we ordered , a ... take out. and rented a movie that we never finished because we ended up
and you had to get up early for work
and by the time i got up you were gone
i remember standing in the closet ... half dressed. reaching for my shoes when i saw that you 'd drawn this heart
you remember that
it was the sweetest thing
and ever since that moment i just felt ... sorry for you
because i knew
i knew that i had you
part of me didn 't want it to work
but it did
archimedes
archimedes
i beg your pardon ? archimedes ' formula
you know , the naked guy who shouted "; eureka
why would she write down a mathematical formula
maybe it 's some kind of code. a language they don 't understand
archimedes ' principle indicates that the upward buoyant force which is exerted on a body immersed in a fluid
aram
um
water displacement
boats displace water
she 's trying to tell us how they 're getting her out of the country
contact the coast guard

we 're combing through the manifests now. where are you
waiting on reddington
he still hasn 't shown
i 'm telling you , keen

these guys , the pavlovich brothers
you remember what they did
you were there that day on the bridge
when we take them down , i want you to be there
i will be. just as soon as
i gonna have to call you back
nice try
i was thirsty
where is she
who
xiaoping li. you took her
you used the fbi and the pavlovich brothers to get to tom and , what
get xiaoping , make some bigger deal ? trade on her secrets
i have no use for germ warfare
and as for using the fbi
i wouldn 't be in this relationship if there wasn 't a mutual benefit
where is she
i don 't know
i tried to bargain for her life , but negotiations went sideways
it was all i could do to get tom
if we don 't find her , if she gets sent back to the chinese
she 's going to die
tell me what you know
we think they 're putting her on a cargo ship. we 're not sure
we 're looking over the manifests , time tables and shipping routes
she isn 't cargo , lizzy , she 's contraband
this is a smuggling operation
and nothing is smuggled in or out of the chesapeake
without rolph cisco knowing about it

rolph cisco
tell us about the pavlovich brothers

it 's okay , it 's okay
easy , easy
come here
i 'm going to put you down
easy , easy
you broke my thumb. yeah , i did
if you 're looking for sympathy , you might want to start with honesty
here 's an example of honesty , tom
you 've been making me pancakes for two years. i hate pancakes
you want honest
here 's one
if you 're going to handcuff somebody
don 't break their thumb
your handcuffs
one on the wrist
one on the banister
do it
i am not here to hurt you , liz
my job was never to hurt you
i 'm one of the good guys
i will find you
i can prove it
the key in the lamp
i know you found it
take it to radford bank
box number 3929
he is not who you think he is
goodbye , liz
you want me to stop him
we 'll just let the tail follow him
tell me about whitefog
whitefog was a black project started by the chinese about five years ago
you wanna tell me what 's going on with agent keen ? sir
where was she today
and don 't tell me you don 't know
was it reddington

i think she 's having trouble at home , sir
i lost him
he 's gone
this whole time you 've never let him out of your sight
your people are following him now
they are
how is this all going to end
this is an end
and then something new will begin
you deserve the best in life , lizzy
i know that sounds odd coming from a man who 's brought you some of the worst
but it 's the reason why tom had to work so hard to be that for you
to be kind. to be thoughtful. to make you laugh
because you deserve that
and it will come

the student of prague made film history in 1913 as one of the first "; artist films
for the premiere of which a score was composed
the film was exported to many countries and helped establish the worldwide reputation of german silent films
sadly , the film only survived in a re-edited version from 1926 and abridged english-language versions for foreign markets
it wasn 't until 1987 that the first attempt at a reconstruction of the original version was undertaken under the direction of dr wilfried kugel
this new digital reconstruction by the filmmuseum münchen is based on the outline by hanns heinz ewers , the original piano score by josef weiss and contemporary reviews
the german intertitles have been re-set according to historical templates
judging from the duration listed by the censorship office in 1913 ( 1,548 metres , 85 minutes ) , the film is still missing roughly two minutes of footage
the instances of missing pictures are replaced with short periods of black frames
musical prelude and interlude were already without pictures in the original

it was the beginning of spring
we had been travelling for two days
we started talking about love
poznichev , who had killed his wife under critical circumstances
i will tell you how that love has taken me to what has happened
until i was 30 i lived in luxury , but i was looking for a wife , young and pure beyond reproach
i returned home enchanted and convinced of her perfect morality. she deserved to be my wife
i made my proposal to her
all married this way , i did the same
three of four days after the wedding , i found my wife depressed
there was no dispute , it was a sudden revelation of a gulf that separated us
the second dispute had especially shown me that its motif was unpredictable
the children for us were a pretext for fights too
this is how we lived
our relationship became more and more poisoned
thus was our relationship , when that man appeared
i insisted that he came the same evening , with his violin
they played beethoven 's kreutzer sonata
terrible , that sonata
learning that i had to leave two days later , groukhatchevski , taking a holiday , said that he considered it impossible to stay with me during my absence
that was pleasant for me
me dearly beloved , we are all well
we wait for you
i am very bored
groukhatchevski has brought me sheet music and wanted to play again , but i refused
yours forever

there 's nothing to do
this market has closed
how long
women of đồng xuân market are determined
no support for france
no sales to france
why do you ask me like that
women and children had to evacuate , but it is ruined for men to follow them
if they shoot , leave them alone
it 's not easy to have days like this in human life
my family has been in hanoi for several generations , since đồng xuân market had just a few sparse huts
if you live a lot , you will be humiliated a lot , gentlemen
therefore , i was so happy when i witnessed brothers punched houses to beat westerners
so these sisters ban the market , i 'm even happier
after just one night of their meeting , no one sold to french guys anymore
only the most holy sir hồ could called the people like that , folks
like today , when ladies flocked to the barracks
truly ladies trưng-triệu 's descendants
could they not be released
that 's right
if they don 't pay back , it won 't be enough for us
just one day of our strike and they 're already in trouble
the colonial species only lost food for one day and they were saddened like dogs droopy tails
if our people don 't have vegetables , they will not die

on the "; old bridge
she tells her story
my father died suddenly , and the house was filled with sorrow
then duke alexis , my uncle , came
my mother was broken-hearted and he became the master of the house
one night i heard an anguished cry echoing
i tried everything , but it was in vain
it was as if she were mad and would not listen to my accusations
i also fell into a strange kind of lethargy , but it did not dim my conscience
when i recovered my senses , after many hours , we were already far away
a poor fisherman took pity on me and hid me
but the villains would not give up
they still waited and , the other evening , i managed to escape them
- but why don 't you go to the police

the villains sought help from some suspicious characters in the town , who joined together , assisted by an intelligent dog
the dog

- i don 't have much money on me , but
- no. thank you
help me , maciste
help me , maciste
the road winds on. the villains realise they are being followed and they thwart their pursuer , by paying off the driver

in order to continue the journey they need to travel to another station far away

any 35 mm. cut of this film seems to be lost nowadays
manuel peña rodríguez preserved one copy , which was given in the late 60 's to the national arts fund. in 1971 , technician fernando vigévano made a 16 mm. internegative from that 35 mm
copy , which was later destroyed. that internegative is currently preserved by the national film museum , and it was used for this edition
the screening speed was adjusted , the colour tones were improved , also , some intertitles , formerly unreadable due to poor contrast , were also restored
even after my death
the city of silence , where pride and ambition shudder
shadows and memories sleep under the peaceful cypresses
in each gravestone , a story , a name , a date
if only the most private tragedies of those standing by the graves could be read , too
here lies elvira meró may she rest in peace
that morning , a man and a child were standing by a humble grave. what a sad memories they seemed to be evoking
the man was mature. his features and manners revealed his distinguished origins , also the passing of time and the effects of thoughts
the child was a spring-like portrait of the man
a string of reminiscence stroke the man 's spirit
in just a few minutes
his tortured mind went through twelve years of memories
rosario , 25 september 19
dear carlos
please hire miss elvira meró
i 've already spoke about her
she 's well educated , and reliable. she 's may serve you to works of trust
she 's an orphan and has no friends or relatives
your sister
- you 'll be cashing up daily , also putting the money in the safe and handing accounting forms to me
- this is the key
- the manager , please
- our new cashier needs a place to live - please , recommend her for some good decent guesthouse
- thank you very much
luis rodriguez and sofanor garramuño , two medicine students whose night studies obliged them to sleep during the morning
garramuño wouldn 't want to graduate as some quack doctor , he was almost turning into an old man before graduating
mrs. abundia de palomeque , the widow of three captains dead during the war against paraguay. she earned her own living by providing lodging for guests
they were lacking of wine
- add some water to it
- enough
- didn 't anybody give you hygiene lessons
dear mrs. abundia de palomeque
it is with great honor that i hereby recommend
miss elvira meró , our cashier. she wishes to stay at your house , where she will feel as home
a. justo
- you can rest assured. l 'll be like a mother , or even like a father
- this piece of junk won 't awake anyone else
- this projectile was thrown at me from your house
- who stays at the higher floors
- two students
but don 't get mad , mr. justo
i 'll deal with them. not only they don 't pay the rent , they also damage my reputation
- that projectile was not thrown at the soup tureen , but at my head
- l 'll punish these punks terribly
the students took position with their own artillery
- if this gentleman insists in molesting this lady , - i 'll kick him so hard - that his own family won 't be able to recognize him
lunch time
l gladly introduce mr. ambrosio hair to you
he invented an anti-baldness device
its effects are quite remarkable
please , see for yourself
mrs. abundia begins taking her terrible vengeance
what are you laughing about , mr. bad manners
luis and garramuño must go and find our daily bread
appetite has a good nose
- do you like candies and pastry , boys
- we sure do
- l 'll give you lots of them if you call me dad
- yes , dad
elvira 's kindness inspires her to be generous to her two nice and unfortunate fellow guests
- chocolate cream and pastry for my little children
- get your finger out of your nose
- you can 't hit me ! you 're not my real dad
- what are you doing here
a little help from someone who cares about you
at the restaurant the check turns to be garramuño 's worst dessert
- l forgot my wallet at home
- please , let my children wait here while i go and look for it
- give them whatever they order
merriment comes with a full stomach. garramuño goes to his class
at 7 : 00 p. m . , garramuño 's children are still at the restaurant , causing great surprise and losses
- have your dad forgot about you
- that wasn 't our dad
- he offered us candies and pastries if we call him dad
- another tall story
at night , back at the guesthouse
luis was able to quench his thirst and hunger at a friend 's table. then he met elvira after work
- our family sent us money
elvira decides to go further
days later ... the self-sacrificing instinct , most important virtue in a woman , keeps both students under elvira 's determined protection
- do you remember this
- haven 't your families sent you money again
- it 's late
we 'll walk you home
the good elvira walks with them to the university. she makes sure that they actually attend their classes
her abnegation makes her be late for work. the indignant manager scolds her terribly
thanks to his willingness , luis becomes friend of rich and wise professor doctor ximénez
months later , this friendship between master and disciple makes luis a frequent companion at the doctor 's elegant table
meanwhile , at the humble guesthouse , elvira gets luis ' clothes ready
luis
i waited for you until 11 : 00 p. m . , when garramuño sent me to bed
what a long dinner
were you thinking of me while eating
l left two shirts and six pairs of socks ready for you
the evening goes on in the luxurious living room. the aristocratic girl , not the orphan
- congratulate me. l found a bride with a million pesos dowry
- elvira was waiting for you . - seeing that you didn 't arrive , she left this note
the alcohol and the devil are the enemies of good actions
the alcohol and the typical foolishness of a 20-years-old make luis conceive a strange criminal idea
the sleep always stands by the good people , and fell upon this kind soul like a gentle caress
- what 's all this
- you 're not worthy of her kind actions , - or my friendship
tell her you 're sorry
- young people get confused
- one has to be careful , my child
- rude boys always get through the first open door they find
- what an abusing young man
- l never thought he might do something like this
doctor ximénez pays attention to his daughter 's subjective pleading
- please invite luis to my birthday
he 's a really fun guy
- if that 's your wish , i 'll be very glad to invite him
garramuño and luis are interns at the maternity hospital
doctor and surgeon ximénez gladly invite his disciple and friend luis to a private dinner celebrating his daughter maria esther 's birthday , on next saturday
- garramuño , lend me 500 pesos
l need them , i must buy a gift
the hospital has a holly mission , and garramuño works tirelessly
dear elvira
i 'll have no money for some few days , and i got myself into debt while fulfilling my student duties. l implore you to provide me with 500 pesos , please
oh
a kind cashier like you won 't say no
the bearer of this letter will receive the money
thank you
- l assure you ! she took money from the safe ! see it for yourself
- with whose permission
did you get money from the safe
- you cheated my sister so lowly
- forgive me , sir
her face burned in shame , her soul was tortured by sorrow. the unhappy woman returned to the guesthouse
- l have a terrible headache
she unburdened herself from her sorrow and shame with good old garramuño
- we must return that money
an accusation would be terrible
- we must help her. she 's a good lady. we all make mistakes
- l bring you the money
please , sign this bill for me
- this will teach you to be a man , not a villain
the emotions of such a stressful day make delicate elvira fall ill
unaware of all the damage he caused
luis returns to the guesthouse
- l 'm so ashamed
- don 't be. l 'll graduate soon , and then we 'll get married
- the man who abuses of a naïve , self-sacrificed woman is not a man ! it 's a cynic
this violent rupture with his friend obliges garramuño to change rooms
there he goes with his things
in his blind ambition , luis only cares about that gift he bought at someone else 's expenses
- l feel ill
please , fetch luis
the triumph of evil
- this dose is excessive
who prescribed this
- a medicine student
the tragedy seemed to threaten the house that night , and the night unleashed its own mysteries
cured
cleaning his friend 's messy room
elvira discovers a terrible secret
the sinister idea of death , perhaps a comforting idea in such unfortunate days , came to the mind of this impulsive poor soul
l wish you can be happy with the woman you love , the woman you abandoned me for. good bye forever
at the same time , that other woman prepares herself for a happy night. she doesn 't know that she 's a rival
anticipating his triumph , the drunk , frivolous student dresses up for such a joyful party
dear garramuño , luis doesn 't love me anymore
l now know that he even made a thief of me to give another woman a gift
my only wish was to live for him and with him. given his love for another woman , my only destiny should be death
my good and loyal friend , this is my final farewell
elvira
garramuño goes to the police
l recommend the retention of miss elvira meró , argentinean , 21 years old , regular height , thin , white , blond , blue eyes
meanwhile
i recommend the retention of miss elvira meró , argentinean , 21 years old , regular height , thin , white , blond , blue eyes
the commissar
- look for her at the palermo woods
- no news
miss elvira meró was arrested by agent ivaldi at 23 : 30 hours , when she tried to throw herself to the train
few months later
recommended by garramuño
elvira becomes the governess of a distinguished house
but soon
my dear friend , why did you ruin my comforting resolution of that day
the outcome i feared the most is now becoming true
l 'm having a child and i 'm getting fired
help me , for god 's sake
elvira
the engagement
times have changed
the girls were ashamed of boys before , but not now
only in public charity that poor good soul finds help
reserve an anatomic bed for me , i have an examination tomorrow
- she 's in god 's hands
one more , life and death meet face to face
next day . - she wanted me to ask you to look after her child . - the fact of trusting you
- do you know who is she
no , not you
- look what you did
she donated her body to him , and by being good even after her death , she won his heart definitely
noticing that he destroyed his life and career driven by madness , and that his behave will make him loose prestige among friends and relatives , the new surgeon decides to pay for his actions and exiles himself
he sets course to the unknown
the loyal garramuño satisfies poor elvira 's last wish
look after the child ' , commanded him both the dead woman and his own kindness
and there he was , a complete father , as gentle to the child as a mother could be
- don 't cry , little boy
- tears should not turn into sorrow the joyful dawn of your life , - nor frighten your happiness away , - as mine was when your mother felt in love with another man
the evocation is over now
that man was dr. luis rodriguez , who had come back from exile. and his child , now grown up and educated by dr. garramuño
they visited the grave of their beloved woman and pulled the petals off the eternal flowers of memory
even after my death the end
the fireman
let my house
i 'll get the insuranceand you can wed my daughter
an honest fire
pay no attention to the fire alarm
our play is made up of four separate stories , laid in different periods of history , each with its own set of characters
each story shows how hatred and intolerance , through all the ages , have battled against love and charity . ــــــــــــــ
therefore , you will find our play turning from one of the four stories to another , ــــــــــــــ as the common theme unfolds in each
out of the cradle endlessly rocking . ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
today as yesterday , endlessly rocking , ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ ever bringing the same human passions , the same joys and sorrows . ــــــــــــــ
intolerance
¶ our first story ... out of the cradle of the present
¶ in a western city we find certain ambitious ladies banded together for the "; uplift "; of humanity
even reform movements must be financed
if we can only interest miss jenkins ... with her money
a little affair is being given by mary t. jenkins , unmarried sister of the autocratic industrial overlord ... ـــــــ
seeing youth drawn to youth , miss jenkins realizes the bitter fact that ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ she is no longer a part of the younger world . ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
the girl of our story keeps house for her father who works in a jenkins mill
with a wage of $ 2.75 a day , a little garden , four hens , ditto geese , and a fair measure of happiness and contentment
the little dear one . ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
the boy , unacquainted with the little dear one , is employed with his father in the same mill . ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
¶ age intolerant of youth and laughter
¶ "; the vestal virgins of uplift "; succeed in reaching miss jenkins in their search for funds
we must have laws to make people good
there is dancing in cafes . ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
comes now from out the cradle of yesterday , the story of an ancient people , whose lives , though far away from ours , run parallel in their hopes and perplexities
ancient jerusalem , the golden city whose people have given us many of our highest ideals , and from the carpenter shop of bethlehem , sent us the man of men , the greatest enemy of intolerance
near the jaffa gate
the house in cana of galilee
certain hypocrites among the pharisees. pharisee
a learned jewish party , the name possibly brought into disrepute later by hypocrites among them
when these pharisees pray they demand that all action cease
oh lord , i thank thee that i am better than other men
amen
¶ another period of the past
¶ a.d. 1572 ... paris , a hotbed of intolerance , in the time of catherine de medici , and her son charles ix , king of france
charles ix receiving his brother , monsieur la france , duc d 'anjou
¶ the heir to the throne , the effeminate monsieur la france . ¶ pets and toys his pastimes
catherine de medici , queen-mother who covers her political intolerance of the huguenots ... beneath the cloak of the great catholic religion
note : huguenots ... the protestant party of this period
the great protestant leader , the admiral coligny , head of the huguenot party
what a wonderful man , the admiral coligny , if he only thought as we do
what a wonderful king , if he only thought as we do
the king 's favor to coligny increases the hatred of the opposite party
celebrating the betrothal of marguerite of valois , sister of the king , to henry of navarre , royal huguenot , to insure peace in the place of intolerance
marguerite of valois
henry of navarre
brown eyes , her family of the huguenot party , and her sweetheart , prosper latour
brown eyes attracts the attention of a mercenary soldier
returning to our story of today , we find the embittered miss jenkins ... aligning herself with the modern pharisees and agreeing to help the uplifters
a diversion of the mill workers . ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
to every thing there is a season ... a time to mourn and a time to dance
he hath made everything beautiful in his time
the little dear one having the time of her life . ـــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــ
ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
miss jenkins receives a check from her brother for the purposed uplift of humanity . ـــــــــ
jenkins studies his employes ' habits . ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
they should be in bed so they can work tomorrow . ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
and now our fourth story of love 's struggle against intolerance , in that distant time when all the nations of the earth sat at the feet of babylon
outside of imgur bel , the great gate of babylon , in the time of belshazzar , 539 b.c
merchants , farmers , east indians , with trains of elephants , egyptians , numidians , and ambitious persians spying upon the city
the mountain girl down from the mountains of suisana
the rhapsode , a warrior singer ... poet agent of the high priest of bel
the priest of bel-marduk , supreme god of babylon , jealously watches the image of the rival goddess , ishtar , enter the city , borne in a sacred ark

the two-sword man , belshazzar 's faithful guard , a mighty man of valor
the jealous priest of bel sees in the enthronement of ishtar loss of his religious power
he angrily resolves to re-establish his own god ... incidentally himself

hand maidens from ishtar 's temple of love and laughter
the princess beloved , favorite of belshazzar , in a room of scented cedar , plated with pure gold , in the hareem of my lord the prince
¶ a love blossom from belshazzar . ¶ stricken by her pale beauty , as though by white lightning
the brother of the mountain girl , having some slight trouble with his high-spirited sister , takes the matter to the court
the first known court of justice in the world. note :

the mountain girl 's brother tells the judge that she is incorrigible
the judgment is that she be sent to the marriage market to get a good husband
endlessly rocks the cradle uniter of here and hereafter. chanter of sorrows and joys
¶ resuming our story of today
¶ dividends of the jenkins mills failing to meet the increasing demands of miss jenkins ' charities , she complains to her brother , which helps decide him to action
order a ten percent cut in all wages . ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
they squeeze the money out of us and use it to advertise themselves by reforming us . ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
hungry ones that wait to take their places . ـــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــ
clear the property
the loom of fate weaves death for the boy 's father . ـــــــــــ ـــــــــــ
the exodus after a time of waiting
forced to seek employment elsewhere , many victims of the jenkins ' aspirations go to the great city nearby ... the boy among them
a friendless one ... alone ... as the result of the strike . ــــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــــ
so too , the dear one ... and her father . ـــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــ
fate leads them all to the same district . ــــــــــــ ــــــــــــ
the boy unable to find work ... at last ... ــــــــــــــ ــــــــــــــ
adversity causes the friendless one to listen to a musketeer of the slums . ـــــــــــــــ ـــــــــــــــ
and again in babylon

feeling the boy wrongly convicted by some mischance of fate , the kindly heart sees a ray of hope in the visit of the governor to the city

in 2004 a tinted nitrate print of terje vigen was rediscovered
from this print a black and white duplicate negative was made in 2005
the film 's original intertitles were inserted into the new negative , and the colours were recreated by the desmet tinting method
act one
there lived a remarkably grizzled man on the uttermost , barren isle
he never harmed , in the wide world 's span , a soul by deceit or guile
his eyes , though , sometimes would blaze and fret most when the storm was nigh , -
and now , all i 've heard about terje i 'll try to tell from the first to last
with land underfoot he was never at ease ; no , better by far then to dwell on the seas , on the mighty ebb and the flow
in autumn , when wild-geese were singing south , he met with their flying skein
a heaviness fell on the sailor 's breast
life lay astern with fire and zest , and ahead lay a winter 's gloom
they anchored , and off his crewmen went with leave for a wild carouse
he watched them with envy and discontent while he stood by his silent house
indoors there were two bestowed
his wife sat and span in the peaceful light , but the crib held a rosy , healthy mite , a baby girl , and it crowed
that instant , and terje 's mind , men say , turned sober upon the spot
he would sing all his happiest ditties there , where little anna tugged his brown hair and lay in his folding arm
life ambled along till the year of war in eighteen-hundred and nine
the tale 's still told of what people bore , where want and distress combine
cruisers from england blockaded each port , by land there was dearth far and wide
the poor people starved , the wealthy went short
two powerful arms were no longer support with death and disease outside
then terje drooped for a day or two
but his miseries quickly go
he thought of a comrade , ancient and true : the sea 's great ebb and its flow
the smallest dory there was to hand he chose for his skagen trip
sail and mast he left home on land , such gear he thought best not ship
when winds stopped blustering quite so wild , -
- terje vigen rowed for his wife and child crossed the sea in an open boat
the jutland reef was the devil to clear , but worse , he 'd the english blockade to fear its look-out 's eagle-eyed gleam
to be continued
act two
at fladstrand , reaching there safe and sound , he gathered his precious stores
here was the staff of life to hand ; and his wife and baby call
the fourth morning , at dawn , by sun 's first rays , a blurred , misty line to scan
near home at last ; -
that instant the word froze on his lip
gæsling 's the shoal with hidden top just east of the homborg sound
the english officer shouted "; stop ! "; he hoisted an oarbutt , let it drop , and stove in the dory 's shell
there on the innermost beach ashore watches my wife at our pitiful door and waits with our baby for bread
he dived and he swam and he dived yet again
in two feet depth all that treasure sank
they lifted him out and over the side
he offered his sorrow , they sold him their glee
then terje fell silent , all hope was past , he locked up his grief in his soul
he languished in prison for many a day , for all of five years , say some
his shoulders rounded , his hair it turned grey from dreaming about his home
then eighteen-fourteen came and with it accord
a swedish frigate brought home onboard - - norway 's prisoners , and terje too
back at the jetty he came ashore a pilot by king 's decree
but few recalled in the greybeard they saw , the youngster who braved the sea
his house was a stranger 's ; and how they fared those two , inside he soon found
the husband forsook them , and nobody cared , they came to the plot that the paupers shared , in the parish burial-ground
to be continued
act three
years went by , and he kept to his trade as pilot out there on the isle
his eyes , though , sometimes would blaze and fret , when the reef to the breakers ran high
and then people sensed he was troubled yet , and then there were few who felt no threat with terje vigen by
one moonlit night , with onshore wind , there was a stir where the pilots sit
an english yacht being carried in with mainsail torn and jib split
close-reached to the weather , a cutter sped
like a hero he seized on the wheel
preserve us alive from the breakers ' roar , l 'll make you as wealthy as wretched before
the pilot let go of the craft
his cheeks they went white , and his mouth shaped a sound , like a smile that at last can break free
the yacht was broached and ran squarely aground , his lordship 's queen of the sea
abandon the ship
to the boats , i say
my lord and my lady , stay near
to ieeward he glanced at gæslingen 's top , and to windward at hesnes ' swell
he let go helm and the foresail strop , he hoisted an oarbutt and let it drop , and stove in the cutter 's shell
anna , my child ! "; she cried out in dread
to be continued
act four
they grounded and sank , but calmness itself inshore of the arc of rough seas
there 'snocausefor grief ! "; "; a sunken dory supplies our relief , three barleygrain casks our dock
he knew , now , the sailor that on his knee had crouched on his deck and wept
you sailed at ease in your mighty corvette , -
- i rowed in my humble boat
i toiled for my own in my forehead 's sweat , you robbed them of bread , and could mock me yet and over my salt tears gloat
it 's time for my vengeance to strike , beware
stand back there , my lord
one step if you dare , and your wife and child is the price
but terje 's forehead showed peaceful and fair
and now terje vigen 's himself again
like a rocky stream flowed my blood till then ; for i had to - i had to repay
the years i spent in the prison 's roar , they bred my heart 's sickliness
but now it 's over
we two are even
when daylight had broken , then all was well ; long lay the yacht in port
one day milord and lady came by
no , rescue came in the nick out there from this little mite by me
the yacht then headed for hesnes-sound , - - with norway 's own flag for wear. he lay to the sun and the winds ' keen weight , and that 's why the grass was so stubborn-straight , but with wild field-flowers between
the end
in 1956 , fernando birri and the santa fe documentary school rescued "; the last indian raid "; from oblivion. a 35 mm copy , provided by alcides greca 's family , was screened then
in 1968 , rosario 's film society rendered it into a 16 mm copy. the technician fernando vigévano was in charge of the project
since the 35 mm copy is considered lost , the new restored cut had to be made from the 16 mm version preserved by the museo del cine
according to film society member alfredo scaglia , and historian jorge miguel couselo , the original cut had several colour tones , something usual in those days
those colour tones were lost during the 16 mm rendering , in which only b / w film was used. in order to restore that
cousuelo 's notes were checked , and also the testimonies of film society member octavio fabiano , who was able to observe the original film
intertitles extension was also improved. in the 16 mm version , intertitles extension had been distorted because vigévano had to copy almost all intertitles from stills , choosing the most clearer ones
some texts , formerly unreadable due to poor contrast were also restored. a new title was made , inspired in the original design , and a likely correct speed for projection was estimated

the mocovi , ancient owners of that land , were expropriated. they fish "; sábalo "; ( prochilodus platensis ) using a "; fija "; , a kind of harpoon made of tacuara and a piece of iron or hard wood
they use modern weapons for hunting macaws , maguari storks and wild ducks that inhabit the nearby lagoons
they use "; bolas "; for hunting ostrich , a highly profitable activity given its tasty meat
they hunt caiman , a dangerous animal that lives in water habitats such as lagoons and streams
they use a thick fishing line , a spear and meat. the caiman eat the meat through the night
the mocovi are farmhands in the local ranches of san javier
moving away
cutting
latagá "; ( cane ) is the mocovi 's worse enemy. they get drunk at the local "; pulperías "; ( tavern
the white people pushed them to drink
now they punish them and even take them to jail for drinking
while the mocovi were living in misery , the tribe 's old chief , bernardo lopez , was living like a king in the land that the government had given to him
rosa paiquí , a beautiful half-breed girl , was his loving companion
jesus salvador , the old chief 's brother , missed the old days , when he would roam in the woods
he regretted the day when he and his people were leaded to san javier by a franciscan missionary brother
who he was secretly in love with
the tribe 's poor living conditions , the hatred he felt toward his brother and his love for rosa leaded him to dream of becoming the mocovi 's chief
salvador visits bernardo in order to convince him of taking care of the people
- bernardo , sleeping all day long
our people are hungry. go talk to the police chief and get our land back
- i won 't make chief benito angry
jesus ' generosity left a print in rosa 's heart
salvador
rosa
me , i love you so much ! take this necklace , made of caiman and "; yarara "; teeth
wear this and you will defeat the white and become chief
i bless you jesus , our savior
act ii the conspiracy
salvador summons his younger brothers and the tribe 's "; curacas
- the reason why i have summoned you is that i am tired of working for the gringos , tired of suffering
bernardo is not helping the indian
the gringos have taken our land
our people are starving
let 's kick them out
gringos have lots of arms
indians only have hunting rifles and spears. we can 't fight them
- gringos will bring troops from santa fe in order to defeat us. chief benito is mean. he puts us to jailç if we drink "; latagá
he has forbidden the ball
the police chief has been taking away our daughters and sisters
together we can defeat the gringos
saint francisco javier will protect the mocovi
the bullets will turn into mud
the indian will fight using indian weapons
the gringos will turn into pigs , and the town will be ours
their women and houses will belong to us
juan and andrés are cowards , just like chief bernardo
they fear the gringo
salvador is not scared
if salvador becomes the chief and kicks the gringos out , i will be his woman
you will be chief salvador 's wife , and the gringo 's daughters will be your servants
the chasquis ( messengers ) were quickly sent to santa rosa and san martín in order to spread the news about the upcoming revolt
several aboriginal families immigrated to san javier in a two year period. strange ceremonies were held at night
each indian swore to be loyal to the mocovi cause and to keep the rebellion a secret. they left an amulet in the chapel , the same they would wear the day of the battle
those mocovi , who were still loyal to chief bernardo , took care of his affairs
the tribe 's spies kept a close look on the enemy 's activities the white people from san javier enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle without noticing that a tempest was about to start
meanwhile , in a hidden corner of the region
jesus salvador was proclaimed chief by the tribe notables
love affaires , balls and religion
the day of the uprising was approaching and that year the mocovi pushed the boat out to celebrate san javier 's day
the procession
the mocovi carry their saint to the church
the mocovi celebrated through five days and nights. the executed their traditional dances : "; sarandí "; , "; tontoyogo
bravo "; and "; cielito
the fellows took a chance to dance with the ladies
those that broke that rule were tied to a pole
they were bailed out if they paid in money , cigars or alcohol
the mocovi sang amusing and kind of melancholic tunes , though they were not refined
- mr. san javier ! mr. san javier
pray for us , the poor ones
us , the poor ones
turn around again , cenciona valdé
the turn you have made , you 've made it in reverse
long live santa rosa
dance , dance sinforosa
stomp your feet fellow
stomp your feet like the chestnut horse does
your love affairs are like a yoyo. like a yoyo
sometimes they improvised for the local tycoons ' amusement
- mr. pancho troco
mr. pancho troco
buy us some gin
have a drink
rosa , who had been forbidden to dance by the chief , remained seated among the old ladies , absorbed in sad thoughts
she rejected many gentlemen that had invited her to dance
but she couldn 't resist one , who didn 't care about bernardo 's orders
bernardo sees that his orders were not obeyed
and forces rosa to comeback home
- you were dancing with salvador , that thief
don 't insult him
i 'll teach you
the next day , two of bernardo 's men took rosa to a faraway corner in the islands
rosa was kept in there for several weeks , in exile , thinking about salvador
ananoque , one of salvador 's loyal helpers , had tracked her down
every night , while the guardians were asleep , ananoque visited rosa and told her about salvador and his plans
chief salvador sends this ceibo ( national flower of argentina ) and cochiyo for the day. i 'll keep you up to date
act iv. the regression
the indians had started to go back to a more primitive stage
they had moved away a large amount of stolen cattle to the islands
several farmers were killed in their own land
not even the bullets could hold the hungry of mocovi back
the land owners and farmers constantly complained to the police chief
the mocovi , who prefer mare meat over any other kind , would not miss a chance of satisfying their appetite
many mocovi were arrested for committing such crimes
this reprisal urged jesús salvador to quickly gather together all his followers
juan and andrés , salvador brothers , were planning to murder chief bernardo
bernardo found shelter at the police station
meanwhile , the people in the town became aware of the imminent danger
women and children panicked
april 21st , 10 am. tension between people in town and he indian was growing fast. the battle was about to start
the sky over san javier turned threateningly black , and a tempest broke in the islands
rosa hears the ostrich booming. it was the sign she was expecting. the rebellion had just started , and she decides to act
i 've hurt my hand
bring some water from the well
there you go
so you won 't be cheating on bernardo again ! evil woman
act v
chief benito reacts to the mocovi attack
at noon , the mocovi interrupted the communications by cutting the telegraph wire
the governor of santa fe received the following message
this telegram and some other alarming rumors reached the capital city through different via. the newspapers reported out the terrible events
news received from different places confirms mocovi indian uprising in san javier
town inhabitants were slaughtered. last telegram received at the government says : "; thousands of insurgent indians ...
personnel are assumed dead when going
meanwhile in santa fe , rumor had it that the storm hadn 't have started yet in san javier
gaucho feliciano luna went to see the mocovi in order to claim the horses they had stolen from him
hey you , chief of thieves , give back the horses you have stolen from me
- indian did not steal any horse , old luna
how dare you
thief , give back my horses , otherwise i will
they are going to kill luna ! fire
five minutes later
the town was besieged by the raging mocovi for two hours
the battle ended. the tribe had been defeated
san javier 's brave youths went after the fugitives
the wounded mocoví hid in the rushes and tried to heal their wounds
that night , in the ranches ... the neighbors set the mocovi campground on fire
several groups went out to watch out the surroundings , where the indians had supposedly committed terrible crimes
the defeated mocovi ran away toward the islands , heading the gran chaco , avoiding the northern towns
one group of rebels remained standing. commanded by salvador , they had changed their objective. they couldn 't conquer the town , but they would capture bernardo
the old tribe chief was away from the anger of the mocovi
the police dismantled the group of rebels. jesús salvador and his loyal ananoque managed to go in san javier in order to reach the islands
at the sunset , the two mocovi , living symbols of defeat , approach shack where rosa paiquí was kept prisoner
that poor half-breed girl was still tied to the post
all of a sudden , an awful scene took place in front of her sad eyes
salvador
the police
the loving couple , hiding in the shadows of the night , managed to get rid of their chasers. they were heading gran chaco , the land of the indian , taking unknown routes on their way
epilogue
once there , in the land of high breakaxes and noble palm trees
jesus salvador was the chief of rosa paiquí 's heart
the restless indian , who fought against civilization , took from it its sweetest legacy
the kiss , which was unknown to his people

a story in pictures ( seven acts ) about the destiny of two people
the story takes place in iceland in the middle of the 18th century when the strict laws caused many outlaws to hide in the hills
the main characters ' lives are based on historical facts
halla is pronounced hadla and kári is pronounced kauri
halla is molded after a danish woman 's spirit
act one
björn bergstéinsson , the county sheriff
the sheep have been unsettled today
the boy lost two of them up in the hills
arnes , an itinerant worker
go and find those sheep right now
heaven help you if you don 't
a stranger
have you ever seen such beautiful lichens before
i 've got a whole bag full of them
boiled in milk , they taste great
smart move
you call this lichen , too
you think it would taste great if you boiled it in milk
put the knife away
you don 't have to worry about me
my name is kári
i come from the south , looking for work
do you know of anyone who can use two strong arms
halla 's farm is there , down below
she 's a woman of generous spirit
she might have work for you
halla , a wealthy widow
the county sheriff björn is her brother-in-law and neighbor
take this chest upstairs
there is a man of mighty strength
his name is kári , from the south
he 's looking for work
i thought maybe you might find him useful on your farm
you can stay for a month and try it
the county sheriff is riding in
i saw that tramp arnes out there
my deceased brother wouldn 't like to see the likes of him in his home
and who is that fellow
he 's a new worker i just hired
i want to speak with you in private
i 'm not good with words
i 'm 48 years old , but you 're no youth either
if we were to join forces , we 'd have the largest estate in the county
would you consider marrying me
you find it so ridiculous
now you 're showing your true colors
when your brother told you he wanted to marry me , you said it was a disgrace for the family that he 'd marry a servant
your advice to him was to satisfy his lust , but without getting married
i have a hidden place where i hide the words my friends have shared with me
you sure are your mother 's daughter
end of act one
act two
kári was like a man in a fairy tale
he fell down a deep well , thinking he 'd never see the sun again
but suddenly he was in a green field and there was a castle
and the king 's daughter walked towards him
i thought you could have this quilt for your bed
if i was a widow and owned a farm , maybe you would treat me differently
that big a farm doesn 't exist in this country
in the county church on a sunday in the late summer
who is that man
no one can escape their destiny even if they run faster than the wind
that man is not kári
that is ejvind from the hills down south
a few years ago , he was the one who
are you sure your eyes don 't deceive you
that same sunday , there was a harvest feast at halla 's
when you laugh , your hair rides up your brow
if you have something you need to hide , keep your eyes and ears open
you have an enemy
i was not aware that i have vexed anyone here
your very existence is enough to make enemies
as of today , kári is the foreman here on the farm
obey him as you would obey me
i wish to speak with you in private
today i got some news , and as your brother-in-law
i see it as my duty to inform you
a man from the south is staying with me , and he recognized your ' foreman ' as a thief named ejvind
i wanted to let you know so you can be spared any embarrassment and get rid of him
i think i know why you are spouting accusations against kári
but you 'll never make me believe that he 's a thief
come outside and tell him yourself if you dare
this man says your name is ejvind and that you are a thief
what is your response to that
that 's a lie
you come here to listen to untruthful accusations
i 'll give you something more entertaining than that
you 'll see how a man like kári treats a mean backstabber
the county sheriff will have to fight the one he calls a thief
you 're crazy
an honest man will not fight a thief
the sheriff says he won 't fight a thief
he 's just trying to get out of it
he 's a coward
björn bergstéinsson has never been called a coward before
end of act two
act three
kári will be back in jail before sunrise
give me your hand , kári , and tell me you 're innocent
you don 't believe me either
tell me you are innocent
in this matter , i am innocent
i 'm so happy to know you are innocent
i 'm so glad , i could kiss you
kári
will you marry me
halla
i can 't
are you married
no
i didn 't think that your eyes could lie to me
you should go
my eyes haven 't lied
i knew a man by the name of ejvind
he was poor and had many children
they often went without food
ejvind went to the priest to borrow some food
he offered labor in exchange , but the priest wouldn 't help
there was a snowstorm and it was late at night
ejvind went past the priest 's sheep pen
temptation got the better of him
the snowstorm would cover any tracks
and the priest was wealthy enough
i hated him
late at night , ejvind arrived home with a large sheep
the next day
a message arrived from the priest
they found his mittens in the sheep pen
they said they could prove he had stolen many times before
he was sentenced to ten years in jail
my name isn 't kári
it 's ejvind
i 'm a convicted thief
i escaped
and lived like an outlaw in the hills by the warm springs
i have lost my faith in mankind
do with me as you please
kick me out of your house
turn me in to the authorities
but you have to forgive me
it was poverty and the snow that made me a thief
i don 't want to cry
crying is ridiculous
stand up
i am not a god from whom you should ask forgiveness
there were many times i wanted to tell you the truth , but it became harder with each passing day
i never understood why until now
but now i understand and now i can tell you
kári has loved you
you are the only woman he 's ever loved
but kári is no more and has never been more than a poor man 's dream
he 's loved you for a long time , but has never seen your beauty until now
like a blue hill , rising from the mist
close your eyes , kári , and sleep a moment longer
kiss me
i want to sleep with my eyes open
end of act three
act four
so , you see , there is no doubt in my mind that my sister-in-law 's foreman is the escaped convict
ejvind of the hills
you need to arrest him immediately
where is kári
you shouldn 't have to suffer any longer on account of me
i will turn myself in
we will find him
he will not be free for long
thank god , they are gone
i have to leave very shortly
i 've asked arnes to help me
when the sky is red in the morning , i will be far up in the hills
god bless you , halla
should i ask you to marry me a second time
i thought we were married
in god 's eyes , we already are
in that case , isn 't it customary for a wife to go with her husband
will you be my wife and follow me through all suffering
yes , i will
you can 't run away with me , halla
you don 't know what kind of life that is
and you 'll forever be called a thief-- like me
you 're such a child
if i can 't marry you , i have to marry the county sheriff
you 're so beautiful
all our time together is reflected in your face
your soul lives in your eyes
when you look at me , i feel an invisible hand caress my face
tonight , we will ride together towards the hills
house , home and honor-- she gave it all up for him
they reached the plains in the early morning
onwards and upwards
end of act four
act five
they had lived like outlaws for five years , hunted like animals
but they were the rulers of the hills
everything they could see belonged to them
when the sun hits the edge of the glacier , you see the most beautiful colors even though it 's colorless and full of mud and ice
love was the sun in their lives
and now i 'm an outlaw , too
i 've lived in the hills alone for two and a half years
when she arrived in this world , the sun was shining and the sky was warm and blue
they never felt alone
they were kindred spirits
there was a wasteland in their souls
i will tie you now , tota , so you won 't fall in the river while i do laundry
the sun is high in the sky already
i better take this to halla before we go on
what do you say we go around the falls and try our luck getting to the lake on the other side
i think you were more scared than i was
your whole body is trembling
there are human tracks here
don 't tell halla about it
she 'll just worry
end of act five
act six
god is sometimes far away , but the judgment of man is always near
it 's not impossible
it could be ejvind of the hills and his cohorts
love can make one person good and the other one bad
i 'm going to the river to wash up
i need to get this sweat off my body
you should have a talk with arnes
he 's more depressed with each day
i think he wants to leave
tell me , why should some men be happier than others
kári has been happy for seven years
one time when you were ill , i gave you some green shoots
they had just sprung out of the snow
and you kissed me
is your soul at peace now
may i kiss you on the mouth
just this once
your lips won 't hurt from it
i gave my husband everything-- including my conscience
i don 't know what came over me
a devil dwells inside me
i love you
i understand now that i have to leave
i can 't stay with you two , and i can 't live alone
i will return to the people , and they can do what they want with me
farewell , halla
i will think of how lovely you are when i 'm in jail
someone 's coming
there 's eight of them
you have to run-- don 't waste any time
i won 't leave tota
it 's too late
there 's three of us against the eight of them
you have to give the child to them
get them
it 's björn
i won 't give my child to him
you devil
do unto others as you would have them do unto you
end of act six
act seven
after a long life together , desperate times struck
it was a winter night so bad , the grass trembled in despair
starvation tore at the bonds the years had built up
close the door
this storm has lasted for seven days
do you think it can last much longer
hunger came to them in their dreams with sizzling meat that demanded their love as payment
we promised each other not to speak of food
i want food ! food
shame on you
don 't you think i 'm suffering as much as you
but i 'm silent
you made me stay here
if we die of starvation , it 's all your fault
who did the stealing
was it me
you 're ugly
i never saw it before
your face looks like a dead horse 's head
is your hair coming out
i thought you were the only person that understood that i couldn 't help what i did
are you leaving
i beg you , please
stay
for my sake
we 've lived together for 16 years
we ought to die together
you were happy once when i ran away with you into the hills
you carried me across the rivers until i was strong enough to wade through myself
all the nights we slept under the stars
every morning we felt on our face was like a blessing
you kissed me and said you loved me
i would rather you kill me before you go
stab me with your knife here
i won 't scream
it will be like a bite from a breastfeeding baby
and one of his disciples asked
teach us , lord , how to pray just as john taught his disciples
he said to them , ' when you pray , say
father , hallowed be your name , your kingdom come
for thine is the kingdom and the glory forever and ever
amen
i once had a dream about two people
their only law was their love
after a long life , they came into hardship
they looked into each other 's eyes and went out into the snowstorm to die together
it 's one 's duty to live as long as possible
you don 't love me anymore
you 've never loved me
will you get some more wood
i 'm cold
god almighty
death brought them absolution
their one law was the love they shared
the end
a day 's pleasure
the family off for a rattling good time
everybody 's doing it
all fixed up for the boat ride
children in arms free
all aboard
i 'll see you later
three minds with but a single thought
ham sandwiches -- buttered popcorn -- cigars - cigarettes
a forced acquaintance
the hold-up at the crossroads
stupid ass

how you have changed
you have been sticking around here long enough

you are so right , father
whoever makes his way here will be saluted by me

tore naesset was only a smallholder 's son , but was nevertheless reputed ... to be the one who most frequently visited the huseby farmer 's daughter
darling , come what may , tomorrow i will speak with your father
tomorrow i will follow you to huseby and propose in knut 's presence

no , no , my lad , don 't even think of such haughtiness

you , knut huseby , are a wealthy man , and i myself am no church mouse
you have many children , and i only have this one son
what if you gave my son your daughter 's hand in marriage
it seems a fair offer , but in this case my daughter will have to make her own decision
go out and find aslaug , sigurd
father wants a word with you , aslaug , and he won 't be pleased to know ... that you stand here wasting time with the smallholder boy from nesset , ... when a bloke like ola thormundsen has come to propose to you
it so happens that aslaug and i have loved each other for a long time
i have come here to ask for her hand
if i can 't have tore , i will not spend another happy day in this world
as yet , there is no tradition here on huseby for farmers ' daughters ... to share the marriage bed with smallholders ' sons
nevertheless , that day is likely to arrive
the end of act 1
a dangerous proposal act 2
a few days later
aslaug brought the cattle to the summer pasture
the next saturday night
only one road led to the huseby summer farm , and it passed right by the main farm
would you believe that boy
he seems to be heading for the mountain farm
god 's peace on the summer farm
god 's peace to you too
it 's just not right that this smallholder stud should be allowed up at the huseby summer farm
well , if no one else can keep him at bay ... i guess me and my sons should give it a try
i may still possess some talent in that direction
come on , boy , let 's have a bout
enough for today , fiddler
come back soon , and i 'll give you some more
don 't forget your fiddle when you come to our wedding
a lazybone like you will have to accept whatever comes his way
while aslaug faithfully yearned , tore approached the huseby farm
if next saturday you manage to slip past the huseby wolf and his cubs , the girl will be yours
the end of act 2
a dangerous proposal act 3
a few days passed
since tore visit to the farm , there had been no news from the valley
what do you want , my lad
how do you do up here , aslaug
you are probably a bit lonely now that nesset cannot come here anymore
yes , he got what he deserve
we fixed him up so well last saturday night , ... that he 's probably lost all desire to go courting again at the huseby mountain farm
come next saturday
tore was fit again , although not in such high spirits as he used to be
if next saturday you manage to slip past the huseby wolf and his cubs , the girl will be yours
in the worst case , i 'll get a good beating
we 're just here to make sure that the smallholder boy from nesset stays away from the summer farm tonight
yes , we would like to join you
position yourselves two at every hill
if he approaches , whistle
i bet ola would love to go to the mountain farm himself tonight
the two of us as well
the girl will finally have to give up ... because the engagement will be broken off tonight
the boys will stand guard down here
the end of act 3
a dangerous proposal act 4
it was on a saturday evening. i had been awaiting you
you promised me to come , but your promise proved untrue
where could you find a rose where no rose ever grows
where can true love be found if your sweetheart lets you down
god 's peace on the mountain farm
god 's peace to you too
that fellow is worth having
the girl shall be his
the shimmering summer air hangs over hardangerfjord
against the sky in bluish hue the mighty mountains loom
the glacier shines , the hillsides are green
the clime is clad in its finest attire
and behold
over green , clear waves a bridal procession sails

tokuyawa , the daimyo travels from europe back to japan
o-take-san , his daughter
father , i am so happy that you have returned ---- during your absence i had to suffer so much from the bonze
o-take-san , your father has brought this for you from the foreign lands
the bonze
karan , the temple servant
noble lord , your servant is guarding the holy shrine from the trampling of foreign feet
may buddha bless your return
you have taken many foreign things to lippon again
i noticed from the gifts for your daughter
olaf j. anderson
so , in a couple of days o-take-san will become priestess in the ' holy forest
if my child wants to - i shall not force her
you have lost your faith in buddha in those foreign lands
fear his wrath
that awful bonze persecutes me , because i have perceived his unclean purposes
but i will pray to buddha myself
and buddha will hear o-take-san
forgive your poor servant , who is not worthy to be buddha 's priestess ... but who wants to sacrifice to the noble one her greatest and dearest treasures : her puppets
buddha will make sure that you are punished
three weeks later the festival of the ' falling leaves ' is celebrated
may buddha bless you
the mikade , his name be praised
thanks you for your message about the traitorous daimyo , who , with foreign doctrines wants to incite the people against the sanctified person of the mikado
the rebellious one will not escape his punishment
an envoy from the mikado awaits you , master
the noble mikado sends you this gift
you know what it means
within 24 hours you must bid life farewell
a gift from our merciful lord , the mikado
a sign of his mercy
go into the garden , for our guests are missing you
o-take-san has something to tell you
the daimyo is dead
as final sign of his devotion to the mikado , he gave him his life
that is the palace of daimyo tokuyawa , he is a favorite of the mikado and his house is one of the most hospitable in japan
your father was punished for your sins by buddha
don 't change your mind , buddha is strict , so serve him as priestess
behind this wall lies the ' holy forest ' , where no european may enter
prepare yourself for it , o-take-san , in a couple of days your initiation as priestess will take place
how did you get here , stranger
don 't you know our strict laws
if you don 't want to fall into the hands of guards you should leave quickly
come tomorrow at the same hour
o-take-san would be a very good geisha for the keeper of the teahouse
a normal garden
i cannot follow you , for soon i will be consecrated as buddha 's priestess
in the evening
come quickly , o-take-san , i want free you , but promise me you will be quit
olaf , you changed a lot
come with us to the teahouse
a new geisha
if you pay well , i will bring you the most beautiful geisha in nagasaki
noble chief , you can only keep this geisha if , according to the laws of the yoshiwara , you marry her for 999 days
you have , however , the right to divorce her , whenever you want
i am willing
the next morning
karan
where is o-take-san
bring me o-take-san , or i
some time later
i can 't approve the marriage of olaf anderson with that japanese girl , for it won 't be long before we return home
holy priest , after much effort i 've found o-take-san
she is married to a foreign marine officer and lives in the teahouse on the hill
be cursed , an unfaithful one
the weeks later
i went to collect my inheritance
this illustrates the three virtues of japanese girls
they may hear nothing , speak nothing and see nothing
this is the sword with which my father killed himself , by order of the mikado
you shouldn 't put so much faith in your happiness , o-take-san
it could change quickly
olaf will never leave me
my dear olaf , it is not nice of you , to make your little wife sad
that little o-take-san seems to really love you
and when the honeymoon was over
greetings o-take-san , don 't be sad
i am travelling back to europe , but
i will return
come back swiftly olaf
you do know ... that you
must come back
the memories of the land where the peaches grow
some little geisha somewhere
little olav , repeat after me
great buddha , grant me my wish and make o-take-san happy again
lord matahari
in four weeks it will be four years ago , that o-take-san 's husband left her
according to our laws , she will be free again then , and must return to the yoshiwara
and if she has no money to buy herself free
i want to know immediately where o-take-san lives
dear olaf
you probably still remember that little geisha , who you married years ago
the poor creature has taken the affair very seriously , and has been waiting all these years with her child in tender longing for you
o-take-san lives with the keeper of the teahouse , kin-be-araki
the bonze wants you to ask her for the rent for the room
if o-take-san cannot pay
she must remain in your teahouse
that stranger paid for three years , o-take-san has been living here with me for four years now and if does not pay the rent , she must leave this house immediately
i have nothing , but my husband , olaf jens anderson , will be back soon , and then you will certainly get the money
in my department i will not allow the oppression of the poor
you won 't be bothered by that landlord again , take this money
o-take-san is beautiful
and i don 't want her to lack anything
today i got the order to set sail for japan. would you like to come along
and when the peach trees were in bloom again
o-take-san , an emissary from lord matahari awaits you
i love you , o-take-san , and if you want
o-take-san , would be my wife
i do not want your wealth
i am the wife of olaf anderson
i 'd rather die than be unfaithful to him
you are mistaken , o-take-san
olaf anderson is not your husband and your mariage
i won 't have you insult my husband , he 'll return soon to me and his child
a european ship has entered the harbor
i can feel that ... it 's olaf
come , hanake , let us decorate the house with flowers for the reception
after a night of waiting awake in vain
i 'm going to the consulate to ask for him
o-take-san 's time is up
she must go back to the yoshiwara
the child will be entrusted to the state
master , help
they want to steal o-take-san 's child
olaf anderson , help for godsake
they are trying to steal your child
now that she is free again , she must return to the ' holy forest
go away
you weren 't concerned about buddha 's sacred service
you just wanted to have your revenge
my gratitude for your protection , lord
but i cannot become your wife
i am the wife of olaf anderson
come , it is at least your duty to help that poor o-take-san
he is coming , o-take-san
he is coming
why doesn 't he come himself
i know ... he has forgotten me
it was your will
he can come collect the child himself , tell him that
go inside and get your child
it 's better to die with honour than to live in shame
where is o-take-san
o-take-san is dead

this movie was digitally restored by the swedish film institute in 2017
for the restoration , the following five elements were used
a black / white nitrate copy with swedish text , a nitrate color copy with dutch text , a black / white dupe neg with english text , a black / white ip and a black / white dupe neg with swedish texts
the film 's original color has been re-created with the dutch nitrate copy as a reference
as some original title cards were missing , they were re-created with the help of the swedish nitrate copy
during the reign of king johan iii a bitterly cold winter swept over sweden the like of which had never been seen in living memory
the king discovered a conspiracy among his scottish mercenary troops
the soldiers of fortune were ordered to leave and they were kept under guard until they crossed the border
their leaders were bold and fearless men. they were arrested and sent to the tower
and the youngest , sir archie
as long as they remained within the bounds of swedish rule they dare not reveal their identities
they donned rough hides and claimed to be journeymen tanners roaming the country in search of work
and by the time they reached the border they were completely famished
in those days , an impoverished fish hawker lived in marstrand a man by the name of torarin
most of the time he was on the road selling salted and dried fish
i have had great news today , grim. the sea has frozen over
not only the bays and sounds , but quite far out to sea
since we will pass by the vicarage at solberga , grim we could stop there and ask if the ice will bear our weight all the way to marstrand
generally , the dog was still and merely blinked at his master 's words
but should he heard something displeasing he climbed on top of the load they carried pointed his nose skywards , and howled
dear dog , what do you have against solberga
have we not many times swung past the vicarage to pay sir arne a visit
at the vicarage , the estate known as solberga the vicar , sir arne , ate his supper in the company of the members of his household
the vicar was an old man who retained his dignity and vigor. sir arne
while the years had not been kind to his wife. the vicar 's wife
seated on the other side of sir arne was the curate. curate
at the far end of the table were sir arne 's niece , berghild and her foster sister elsalill , an orphan taken in by the vicar 's household. elsalill ... berghild
torarin was the only person present not belonging to the household and his gaze kept returning to the ironclad chest at the foot of the fourposter bed
this was where sir arne stored a fortune in silver coins and it was said they filled the chest to the very brim
though torarin was a man of little means he had no desire to possess this fortune for he had heard that sir arne had taken the money from the large monasteries that once flourished in this country and that the old monks had prophesied
why are they sharpening knives over at branehã ¶ g
tell me , why are they sharpening such long knives over at branehã ¶ g on this very night
do you not hear the scraping and filing
do you not hear the hissing and squealing
how can you hear them sharpening knives over at branehã ¶ g
that estate is miles away
pray let us finish our supper
act ii
that very evening a banquet was held at the inn at branehã ¶ g
and all the townspeople were invited
the old saying holds true
the closest neighbor is the last to arrive
i still see them in my mind 's eye sharpening their knives
god only knows what they plan
it was fortunate that the vision lady vicar saw was no more ominous than a few journeymen tanners preparing the tools of their trade
long after midnight , a few men left the inn at branehã ¶ g in order to saddle their horses and return home
come out
come out ! the vicarage is on fire
last night sir arne and his entire household were murdered by three men entering the house by way of the smokehole in the roof
men dressed in rough hides
sir arne 's horse is gone and so is the sleigh
act iii
the impoverished young maid , the sole survivor of the bloodbath , was taken by torarin to come live with his mother and himself in their cottage
torarin 's cottage was situated at the highest point of the island
and all the scottish mercenaries , mariners and fishermen locked in by the ice at marstrand used to pass by his cottage on their way to see if the sea had begun to cast off its blanket of ice
many were the times elsalill regarded those who passed by
she would ponder on how blessed they were to have something to look forward to
she yearned for nothing on earth
i am not wealthy enough , elsalill to feed and clothe you only for you to be idle and nurture your grief
oh , mother katri ! the last to be slain was my foster sister
she pleaded to be spared but one of the men stabbed her to the heart
had i not hidden behind a wall i would be with my dear foster sister now
i hope they are alive , so i may rip the hearts from their chests
i hope they are alive , so i may see them drawn and quartered
we did not come to frighten you , good maiden , but to implore you to share your tale with us
we came to marstrand to book passage to scotland , but all the fjords and sounds are frozen
now we while away the hours and would be much obliged if you were to share your tale with us
show the gentleman you do not lack the breeding to respond properly , elsalill
you were born to a higher station and are not a lowly fish wench
after that day , sir archie often ventured to torarin 's cottage to speak to elsalill
god himself has sent you to me , elsalill
elsalill , will you accompany me to scotland as my wife
there i will build you a castle of which you will be the distinguished mistress
do you see the hair entwining my hand , elsalill
do you see the lock of fair hair
in this very same manner the hair of my foster sister was twisted around the hand of her killer
we frighten ourselves unnecessarily , elsalill
look , it was but a few sunbeams shining in from the window
sir archie , sir archie ! why must you call the dead to mind
leave me , leave me , sir archie
for now my mind dwells solely on the dead
grim , my dear dog , you can no longer doubt that we travel across the sea
look , a large ship is locked in the ice
what do you say ? shall we call to the skipper and hear if he wants to buy our fish
if the ice never broke up it would be impossible to set sail for scotland
sir archie wished to discuss this matter with the skipper
a man like yourself who travels everywhere and hears everything , do you know why god keeps the gates of the sea barred for so long ? holding us all captive
once i spent a whole month in bergen when headwinds were so strong not a single ship could put out
you see , one of the ships stuck in the harbor was carrying a man who had stolen from the church
and he would have escaped , had it not been for the raging storm
as soon as he was brought ashore the weather turned beautiful and the wind became benign
do you now know why i asked why god keeps the gates of the sea barred
he requested passage to scotland for himself and his men but i do not like to have such ruffians aboard my ship
act iv
not long afterwards elsalill had a peculiar dream
she thought she saw her dead foster sister standing before her
elsalill saw that they were in a room where the proprietress of the tavern had her maid stationed to wash dishes and tankards
her sister seemed to beckon her to help wash up
the next day the dream lingered and would not fade
and she was irresistibly drawn to the places her foster sister had taken her in the dream
rather than simply standing there you might come in and give me a hand with the dishes
drink , my brother
sir arne 's fortune is not yet gone
she could not betray him
he was dear to her heart
she could not send him to be drawn and quartered
she could not bear to see his hands and feet seared off
god bless you for coming to see me tonight , elsalill
elsalill , i have not been to see you for many days since grave thoughts plagued me
but when i happened upon you just now my heart told me what i must do to be released from my torment forever
i weep , sir archie for the love i bear in my heart for you is too strong
soon the sea will open and ships will be able to set sail to the country from which i come
elsalill , will you go with me
you must go with me , elsalill or i will be doomed
tonight i will come for you , elsalill
i must have your decision tonight
why are you out here weeping
why did you not stay in the cellar
i left because i did not wish to hear the words of the evildoers on your premises
i happened , however , to hear three men talking and one said
drink , my brother
sir arne 's fortune is not yet gone
if you can witness such words , you do best not to run away
for you must go with me to the rightful authorities so they may seize the murderers and duly punish them
act v
the skipper sent word to sir archie and his men that they may board ship this evening
the sea had begun to open up to the west
they might even gain free passage to scotland before first light
go to the inn and settle things
i must speak to elsalill before we leave
sir reginald and philip have gone to the inn while sir archie has gone to torarin 's cottage
make haste and fly , the town guards are after you
they are looking for the men who murdered sir arne
did you recognize me , elsalill , and set them on me
they are coming for you
go
have you considered that i no longer will have a hope of ever redeeming myself
why did you do it , sir archie
we had been driven mad by hunger and by the cold
we were senseless with drink
i did not know what i was doing
why do you play me false just when i trusted you most
do not fear me , elsalill
i am again the man i was
i have command of my senses
and no harm will befall you on this night either , i assure you that
and using elsalill as a shield sir archie ran for the door
a wild wolf of the woods she had loved. an evil murderer she shielded with her own body
and as sir arne took another step the pike plunged into elsalill 's heart
all night long the skipper paced the deck of his ketch
who could know what possessed the skipper to be out on a night such as this
his crew was safely aboard ship and so were the passengers destined for scotland
it was not until dawn 's early light that the skipper saw the sight he was longing for
fjords and sounds were now open far out to sea
but the inlet where his ship was locked in showed no channels , it was frozen solid
i implore you to help me find the maid the scotsmen brought to your ship last night
last night she was abducted by the killers of sir arne and they brought her to your ship
the town guard will not venture out this far. not to a ship carrying a hundred soldiers of fortune. they are unwilling to engage them in battle
now i know why we have been held back while all other ships may put to sea
it is because we have evildoers on board
stay calm and obey that man
this is the will of god
as soon as the criminals were brought to shore the storm began to rage again
and from his lofty vantage point on deck the skipper saw a lengthy procession approach his ship
it was the womenfolk of marstrand , both young and old
they were clad in mourning and young men carried a litter
they had come to collect the young maiden who had loved an evildoer and had given her life to destroy him
and in their wake the tempest tore up the ice over which they had but lately passed
and by the time they reached marstrand with elsalill the gates of the sea stood open

die spinnen ( the spiders ) was fritz lang 's third feature film ... and the first to establish his reputation as one of germany 's ... foremost silent directors
lang 's work on the spiders ... prevented him from directing the expressionist classic
the cabinet of dr. caligari , a film that had been assigned to him ... by producer erich pommer
the credits of the spiders , however , include several names ... famous by caligari , such as set designer hermann warm and ... actress lil dagover
filmed in 1919 , the spiders was made ... in two parts designed to be shown on two different theatre dates
lang 's plans to complete the serial story with a third ... and fourth part to be titles the secret of the sphinx and for asia 's imperial crown ... were unfortunately never realized
the film 's obsession with diabolical evil directed by ... a powerful but unseen force is a foreshadowing ... of the dr. mabuse films made by lang three years later
part of a series of adventure films in exotic locations ... popular in germany at the time , the spiders was a ... boxoffice success and made decla the leading german studio

each of you knows the great importance of a message in a bottle
it is the last attempt of shipwrecked sailors to send a message
today as i headed toward shore aboard my yacht
i hurried home to open the bottle
to whomever finds this
please notify harvard university ... cambridge massachusetts , immediately that i was taken ... prisoner here near the 75th longitude by descendants of the incas ... who by tradition still faithfully offer human sacrifice to the sun
unbelievable treasures lie buried below the ruins of their temples ... which are probably inherited from their old king
beneath the so-colled "; holy sea "; extends a gold mine , which appears to be inexhaustible
today i escaped my torturers and made it to the coast
in the name of god , help me
may 5 , 1918
fred johnson
i found the point on a map
and wired harvard university immediately
as proof that this mystery really exists. i have the reply

harvard university
consequently , i will not be in tomorrow 's race for the golden trophy ... of san francisco
the golden treasures of the ancient incas are far more inviting

named berta just like you
beautiful and charming , just like you , forced by her parents into a hated marriage

stop , captain
i know my duty as well you know yours
i will fight on your side
my sword will prove that count borotin is no accomplice to the bandits
what was that
where were you
and how did you get wounded
to proceed seemed dangerous , so i returned
i heared the shot from my chamber
as i knew your father was outside

20 years ago i passed the castle , when i saw a handsome boy at the lake
i made him follow me into the dark forest
act six
the others wanted to kill him , but i took pity on him
so your son became mine
he forgot you and honored me as his father
and i thought he had drowned , because his hat floated on the lake
god , my son is alive
bring him to me , even though he is a bandid , i thank you
he is here , he is the stranger that found shelter here
jaromir , my brother

the end
in the film , robert reinert wanted to describe the atmosphere that prevailed in 1919 as a "; nervous explosive
caused by war and misery
the film was modified several times by the censors
the copy distributed at first in 1919 was 2637 meters long
in november 1920 , the office of censorship in berlin had a copy that was 2054 meters long
gosfilmofond in moscow has a black and white copy 1646 meters long , and the bundesarchiv-filmarchiv has a colorized fragment 65 meters long
approximately 777 meters of a u.s. version , whose colors are deteriorating and have a solarized effect , are kept at the library of congress
a third version of has been lost
our reconstruction efforts have tried to be faithful to the original concept of the film
therefore some shots and sequences were swapped and new headings added
colorization reconstruction meets models and conventions of the time
only a few of the "; animated intertitles
spoken about by all the critics of the time were found in the u.s. fragment and near a german outtake
you , messengers of the most intense pleasure and suffering the deepest
when you come to fail , man is reduced to a beast
nerves are you not the essence of the soul

our invention , the largest in living memory , will make us masters of the world
with our tools and machines designed to overcome resistance , we will conquer the whole earth
you hear me
the whole earth
the fluttering flag symbolizes the beginning of our reign

the machine explodes and destroys the new plant
like me , you must have nerves of steel. otherwise , all is lost
panic
roloff will no longer dominate the world
i will continue to fight
professor johannes , an apostle of the people
marja , roloff 's sister
a gap has widened between the haves and the have nots
they seek power , while you ask for bread
people are crying from the bloody battlefields
this is the culmination of this thirst for power , this hideous monster who wanders the earth drunk with blood
but you tremble
growing up , i had nerves of steel but since that time
since i see the dead coming back to take their revenge against us ... against me
hey , marja , your wedding dress
happy child , tomorrow you 'll be married
don 't you feel the air is filled with a mysterious power
don 't you feel the earth vibrate with an unspeakable force
i have to go and see for myself
oh , if only the marriage would not take place
do you know what it means to marry someone you do not love
i want to belong to a man who has a soul
a man like professor johannes
the assistant gardener
what 's going on
the street rises
and you , what are you doing
you coward
let me go , i want to be with them
have mercy , marja
these people are fighting for their lives
and you know nothing else to do , only to turn around , sentimentally weeping , you coward
count richard colonna , marja 's fiance
tomorrow morning , you will give the bouquet to the bride
am i a coward
no , i am not a coward
why
i do not know

blood flows on my wedding day
end of act one
act two
marja 's wedding day
richard : "; did the assistant gardener finally hand her my bouquet
marja : "; this is not a murderer. give him a religious burial
richard : "; he does not deserve it
the blind sister of professor johannes
your little sister is looking for you , professor johannes
mother , why you are no longer alive
you could advise me
matthew 5.28 : "; and i tell you
whoever looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her , in his heart
my brother , i cannot see you , but i feel how much you suffer
the wedding guests
professor johannes - i 'm getting married today
do you remember when you were my teacher
you gave me this animal when there are workers who die of hunger
i was happy at the time
today i am in despair
marja , go
marja has disappeared
i will never marry count richard colonna
my god , what has happened to you
richard , i cannot be your wife
no man of honor can take me as a wife
anotherwouldhavetotake meby force
professor johannes
we 'll talk
my sister did not get married
i 'll explain later
roloff urged marja to tell him what happened
marja , overcome your shame
tell me
i lost consciousness in his arms
roloff is sure her nerves are raw , having seen the scene with his own eyes
the love i bear for him is unclean and full of sin
this professor must be destroyed
how can love , the most beautiful of feelings , be so powerful
mr. prosecutor , this dramatic incident has the advantage of destroying our most dangerous political opponent
the faithful dog
this is not true
this cannot be true
i swear to god , i saw it with my own eyes
end of act two
act three
johannes
the people
my faithful dog , tell me where to find our johannes
night
marja , for the love of christ , tell me the truth
popular rally
an argument broke out
he : "; let us not be misled by ruthless fanatics
intuitively , the blind girl feels there was a relationship between the bible and her brother
who are you
i 'm closer to you than you think
on the day of trial i will prove his innocence
thedayof thetrial
you will apologize for being ill
the shame of your presence at court would be a disgrace to the family
no longer find peace
he was sentenced to six years in prison
i feel as if i have attended the execution of an innocent person
an unbearable tension reigned in the courtroom
he refused to pronounce any word in his defense
given the terrible accusations , he remained silent
then his blind sister came forward
my brother is a good man
he reads the bible every day
whoever looks at a woman in lust has already committed adultery with her , in his heart
the love i bear him is unclean and full of sin
i assume you 're referring to marja roloff
you confess then to an illicit love for marja roloff from long ago
your silence will be fatal
then i swore
i swore i saw the scene with my own eyes
the verdict pronounced , johannes broke his silence
i am wrongfully convicted , but i 'll do my penance
end of act three
act four
professor johannes was sentenced to six years in prison
didn 't you see him stare at me
it 's unbearable
why did he say anything
why was he convicted
herapedyou
johannes would never do such a thing
but i saw it with my own eyes
my poor brother
you saw nothing
yes , i did see
i even testified
my poor brother
it is impossible for you to have seen anything
tell me the truth
johannespossessedmy soul
hedidnotphysicallypossess me
i saw it and i testifed to it
and now she says
what does this mean
am i a fool or a criminal
what 's going on there
we aren 't saying anything
marja must be silent since i have testified so
but you cannot let an innocent man suffer
i committed perjury
i am a notorious liar
alone
i went to the prosecutor
you must do what your honor requires
another inquest will shed full light on this matter
marja leaves the house , resolved to fight for the johannes 's ideas
what 's going on there
where am i
is this my house
help , help
help me
i 'm afraid of going insane
wishing to have a clear conscience , roloff consults a well-known psychiatrist
i have a friend who suffers strange hallucinations
the worst thing is that he blames himself
he gives the impression of being very healthy
here , everyone seems in good health , but all are seriously ill
what is the cause of their illness
the progress of civilization , the struggle for survival , fear and the horrors of war , the sins of the parents
what do you want
what do you have against me
why are you crying
you make us feel pity
nonsense
you cry for your idol johannes , whom i arrested
our marriage , my dear son , was not happy
the doctor speaks of a hereditary disease
the prosecutor has johannes freed
paranoia
you have killed me , roloff
my god , i think that is elizabeth , my wife
if she is dead , it is your fault
nobody ever died as he did
nobody ever went to heaven as he did
i am not a murderer
he committed suicide
is he dead then
his body is visible
he was here , right here
do not cry , i cannot stand it when you cry
am i sick at this point
end of act four
act five
nobody knows why i remained silent
i wanted to atone for my sins
forgive me , johannes
my responsibility for what happened to you is heavier than yours
richard seeks marja , his fiancee , and eventually finds her
richard : "; marja , just turn the page and move on
like you , i left everything
henceforth , i will also defend your noble ideas
my nerves are frayed , just like those of the world
nerves are the disease of the world
our marriage , my dear son , was not happy
his disease is incurable
i know you have forgiven me
i have come to the end of my love for you
now i am richard 's wife
his disease is incurable
why go on living now
now i know why he was silent
a few days later
roloff 's condition worsens
what unhappiness i brought
why are you laughing , you whore
go as quickly as possible
i want escape the images that haunt me
i choked
now death awaits me , too
elizabeth , are you alive
save me , save me
psychiatrists call these horrible images haunting hallucinations
do you understand that i am afraid of my inexorable fate
which shortens the suffering of the terminally ill
help me from failing
respect the humanity in me
as i feel good
johannes , thankyou
he died of a stroke
johannes tries to calm the demonstrators
humanity will not achieve its ideals throught violence

quaker dictates his mail
the good madam daughter has gone stark raving mad
why exactly are you throwing all these newspapers at my head
well , the vases have already all been broken
it 's come to our attention that the daughter of the shoe-polish king , mr blakpott , has married a count
that doesn 't impress me at all
i 'll buy you a prince
i 'm so happy i could smash the whole house to pieces
seligson the matchmaker
but he 's cross-eyed
for that price they 've all got a little flaw
dearest sir
as the daughter of the shoe-polish king has married a count , and as we all know that shoe-polish doesn 't trump oysters , i request that you send me a son-in-law with a pedigree in accordance with my oysters
sincerely , quaker

age : 26 years old
appearance : tip-top
spec
attributes : not inclined to marriage
ossi is instructed in the ways of marriage
you shouldn 't hold a child like that
well , children really shouldn 't be coddled
now you 've got to apply some powder
not on the face
it all goes on the other end
well that 's pretty odd
we haven 't got to that point yet
someone 's ringing
i 'm sure someone was outside pressing the button
i 'll check to see if we 're home
i 'd like to speak with prince nucki about a matter of the heart
i 'll check to see if his highness will receive you
in the meantime have a seat on the banister
his highness bids you to come in
don 't fall over
your highness , i have a proposal for you - a charming young girl . -
this tall
and does she have hair - black as night . -
i go for blondes
then she 'll just dye it
with that kind of money it makes no difference
your little highness
my adjutant will look her over first
put on my suit , so you look presentable
it 's now been 1-1 / 2 hours , and i still haven 't got a husband
if i don 't have a husband within 5 minutes , i 'll demolish the entire house
be my guest
that doesn 't impress me at all
end of the first act
second act
josef presents himself to quaker
might i have your card
prince nucki
take this one for the time being
prince nucki
what do you have to say about that , daddy - that the prince is here
he 's to wait in the parlour
if you come to an agreement , wake me
these folks know how to live
josef grows impatient
where is the good madam
in the bath
- and the good gentleman
asleep
well , what am i supposed to do with myself here
wait
his highness the prince is growing impatient
that doesn 't impress me at all
the good madam in person
in with her
smells good
good lord he looks dumb
oh well , he is a prince after all
so you want to marry me
is that what you want or isn 't it ?
of course that 's what i want - just don 't throw anything
don 't you want to introduce me to your father first
since it 's such a trifle , we don 't want to wake him up
on the way to the ceremony
we 'd like to get married quick
prince nucki , do you take ms quaker to be your wife
you don 't even have to ask - he 's got nothing to say on the matter
but didn 't i get to sit up front earlier
yes , but we weren 't married yet then
tell the servants that i am your husband
they wouldn 't buy it
i hereby introduce you to my husband
well , you see how pleased they are
go into my father 's bedroom and introduce yourself
what 's the nearest route to mr quaker 's bedroom
i 'll provide you with a blueprint of the manor
bon voyage
come blow my nose
well now , who might you be
why this is my husband
and here you are blowing my nose
oh , it stays in the family
end of the second act
third act
on account of the rush , the wedding celebration includes only the closest family members
excuse me for introducing you to my son-in-law
don 't be such a pig
say a few words
it 's been a long time since i 've had such a good meal
in the course of the celebration , a foxtrot epidemic suddenly breaks out
not so exuberant - think about your family tree
oh , bollocks
do you foxtrot
what will your husband the prince have to say about this
i could do with a wedding like this every day
every day pickled herring , - that 's bitter
nucki is called upon by his friends to go for a stroll
would you perhaps be able to lend me a little something
the wedding nears its end
i 'm sweating like an ape
everyone sweats as he 's able
whereabouts is your husband
i 'm so very happy-
why did you get married then
shame on you
- why you 're
i 'm so very happy
what can be done , will be done
here are my rooms , there are your rooms
ohhhhh
go on and call me your sweetie
please remove this gentleman
what a shame , and i was just in the mood
i 'm so very happy-
end of the third act
fourth act
nucki comes back from his stroll
my child , you look pale
the association of millionaires ' daughters for the prevention of dipsomania holds an official breakfast for young ladies
and so i say , in closing
down with dipsomania
if consulting hours aren 't held soon , the patients will sober up on their own
the association 's patients
a shame about the lovely schnapps
hold onto me tightly , my ladies
everyone out
i 'll cure him
no
all right then - we 'll settle the matter with a boxing match
let go of me , my ladies
fight , fight
so now it 's your turn
bring the gentleman to my car
i 'm taking him on a private session
careful
put the gentleman in my husband 's bedroom
the good master is still asleep
then take him into my bedroom
mousey
little mousey
shut it
well if that doesn 't just take the biscuit
i 'm telling the old man about this
these aren 't my trousers
do you have any idea where you are
with you
well , do you know who i am
a sweet little snail
do you know that you 're a delightful kisser
well , i never
please
a pity that you 're married
i have to get married too
do you know that you 're both married to one another
i got married in your name
the real wedding
now , that impresses me
this man has been brought to me as one who misleads the people
he is accused of sedition and blasphemy , for which he should suffer death
my lord governor
my lord governor there is a custom in jerusalem , that at this season of the feast one condemned man should be released
i remember the custom
who shall it be
this man who many of you call their king
or shall it be barabbas
release barabbas
-release jesus of nazareth
-no , not barabbas
-barabbas
-release barabbas
crucify the nazarene
they "; re mad , lord governor. barabbas is a rebel
a robber , an assassin
release barabbas
take the nazarene , scourge him and bring him here again and he shall be crucified
all right , that "; s enough
take him out
open up
come on
one man to be set free
set free
you ought to know the custom of the season
the governor offered them either the prophet or you
he listened to the voices and they chose you
i make no comment. come on
get on the move
all right
give us a hair of your beard
it ought to be lucky , considering how things have gone for you
i "; m not used to the light. lt plays tricks
if i was you , i shouldn "; t loiter
i "; d want to see the back of this place before they change their minds
get on your way , will you
-who do you think you "; re shoving
-get going
all right. i "; m going
move on
-there he is
release the nazarene
-get out of the way
what are you standing for , like an idiot
what are you all hanging around for
here "; s a fine sight
six weeks and nobody "; s moved
what "; s happened then
how did you get out
this is a surprise , let me tell you
is that my duck ? it "; s him
-sara
-there "; s the black knave himself
cheating his death again , like a good boy
the clever one
how did you do it
i was released to celebrate the holiday as a surprise for you
here "; s a day to celebrate in all my god
come on and tell us the whole story
you "; ve not heard
i "; m the choice of the people
give us barabbas , "; "; they said
give me some food
food for barabbas. food for a hungry man
how does it feel
how did you feel when they told you
the choice of the people , eh
old sara here dropping tears so fast all the slopping wine got watered
-where did you get your luck
-what witch gave you that
-touch him for luck. that "; s it
-l "; m not taking chances

where "; s rachel
shut away mourning for me
fetch her down here
she "; s no good for you or anyone else
-she "; s completely changed , i "; m telling you
-what "; s wrong with her
bring her down
she "; s no good to my old rascal now
she thinks of nothing , day or night except this prophet from nazareth , who "; s on trial for blasphemy
ever since she heard him preach , she has gone off her life like a sick child goes off its food
come on , you old empty belly
there "; s no food inside you worth vomiting
sit down and eat
barabbas , that girl "; s no good for you
take my word for it. as morbid as a crow in a chimney
bewitched by a prophet
a waste of a handsome girl
and she "; s gone to his trial looking like a widow already
she knows what happened to her prophet
that "; s the end of him
-condemned , was he
-that "; s just it
they had the choice between him and me , and they chose me
how do you like that
the idol of the city
tell you what. you "; re as good as a king , barabbas
they call the prophet king of the jews , but they chose you
show your respects to king barabbas
-let "; s have a crowning of him
-yes
-the wicked old king of judea
-what are you doing
-come on , give him his robes
-you be nice to your king barabbas
more wives than solomon and his subjects as ripe as old pumpkins
here "; s your scepter. take it
set him on his throne
-what "; s that
-that "; s the scepter
sit down on your throne
kneel down , all you miserable scum of the earth , and acknowledge
kneel down , you scum of the earth
hail ! hail
i "; ll make laws for you that will tax your constitutions
i crown you , king barabbas
what are you treating me like a clown for
here she is , barabbas , if you want her
look here , rachel , look who "; s been asking for you
the old rascal back from the dead
so , here she is
what "; s the matter with me
why don "; t you look at me
barabbas , let me go
not until you "; ve told me you "; re glad i "; m alive
-l wouldn "; t wish any man his death
-what do you mean by that
don "; t make me speak to you
-what do you mean by that
-don "; t make me speak to you
that "; s a warm welcome
i couldn "; t follow any further
i daren "; t say what is still to come , but god forgive us all if he can
what did i tell you
she "; s no good to you now , barabbas
come on
i "; m not here to be made a fool of
what "; s the matter
remember how it used to be
barabbas , don "; t you see what "; s happening
don "; t you understand what set you free
i just got out of prison
i need to get the cramp out of my bones
that "; s what "; s happened
-l "; m not the same. nothing is the same
-you "; d better try and make it the same
barabbas , listen to me
for pity "; s sake believe me
he came from god , the man who "; s taking your place
you think i should have been killed instead of him
you think i ought to be dead
barabbas , hear what i say
he came from god
that "; s none of my worry
god can look after his own
-and you can look after me
-no
that girl up there was always coming back with strange ideas
she "; s got her head full of them
well , it seems she "; s got something to think about now , anyway
-l don "; t like the look of it
-look of what
what "; s the matter
the sky
the light "; s gone out of it
i "; ve never known it dark like this in the middle of the day
get a light , for mercy "; s sake
something "; s wrong with my eyes
i can "; t see
something "; s wrong
everything "; s black
black as death
i knew there was something wrong when i saw that light
tell me. am i going blind
am i going blind
what "; s happening
you know what has happened
even the light has left us , now that we "; ve killed him
well , are you satisfied now
he "; s dead
just the same as any other man
-we "; ve seen it
that "; s the end of it
-he promised to come back
we shall see that , too
only two days and he "; ll be in the world again
look at his friends
you think they believe it
i tell you , you "; re mad
that "; s the end of it
not tomorrow , but the morning after
how many days have i been here
can "; t you hear me
what "; s the matter with you
what "; s the matter
two days
two days
then today "; s the third day
two and one make three
what "; s so odd
we "; ll see , then
this is the morning of the third day
barabbas , where are you going
now you know it "; s true
all i know is the tomb is empty
-who moved the stone
-god moved it
god himself
you saw him do it
a power came from the sky
it was when the sun was rising , at the beginning of the day
-first there was the music of a horn
-horn
then in the air there was an angel
the whole sky seemed to dismantle
it was white , it was fire
it was white fire
he stretched out his arm. it seemed as long as a spear
the point of the spear went between the stone and the rock and the stone rolled away
if only you had been here sooner and seen what i saw
my eyes are good
they see nothing but real things
you have to believe this , barabbas
the master was a man of truth , and he said this would be so
did you see a prophet come out of the tomb
my eyes were so dazzled
i think i must have covered them
but when i could see again a man and a woman were together in the garden
and then she went quickly away
and the man was the same man they buried in there
he was like a shadow
the morning light was behind him
but i "; m sure it was he
shadows , light , that "; s about the truth of it
here "; s the truth of it
why do you think he should lie about himself when it meant he would be killed
how do you know what he said
the priests ought to know more than you do. and they call it blasphemy
he said
love one another
love one another
and they crucified him for that
where are you going
there are those who can tell you more
there "; s a house in the street of the potters where they meet
you may find them there
go and ask them
it "; s a trick they "; re playing
they took the body and hid it to go on with their story
or are you afraid
are you afraid of knowing what has happened
are you looking for someone
you like to see it
the clay making itself
some other day
what "; s happened ? i heard there was news
the tomb "; s empty , the women said they saw him
creed can have strange visions. only it "; s true
where "; s peter
who could it be
don "; t open it
we should get out of this city
wiser to go down to galilee
can we hide from the future forever
let "; s see what is here
what if they mean to destroy us all
leaving no one to tell the knowledge of the man
can the word turn to silence
i "; m not afraid of that
where is he
-what have you done with him
-what do you want with us
-the truth
what happened
-what right have you to be here
you know what i mean
what are you all afraid of
what are we afraid of
you want to know what we want to know
-what is the truth of this morning
-l know the truth
you stole the body
you think we might have hidden it here among us
but something else has happened
if you find him here , it will only be if he comes himself
through that gate , as you did just now
don "; t you believe it. i saw the body
he was a dead man
if you were sure of that , you wouldn "; t be here
he "; s risen
i trust in him and wait
you "; re all mad
what do you think you "; re doing , making that net
there "; s no sea to fish in closer than galilee
it "; s what i "; m used to doing , my hands go to it
but the streets in the cities have to be the sea for me now
he made a joke about it when he took us away from the boats
he said that in the future our fish would be men
it was a serious joke. it meant he "; d given us the word to draw men out of the dark sea into the light
and you call yourself a fisherman
do i have to tell you what happens to the fish
they struggle about , gasp and die
we struggle and gasp
you said something good
poor fish
i , too must struggle and gasp
and die
and die in order to live
that "; s where men have the advantage over fish
they can die to the world , die to the dark sea and begin to live again in the light
that "; s what he promised , and what he promised has happened
but what has happened we still don "; t know
he "; s come back to life
-he "; ll lead us to the new kingdom
-l "; ll believe it when he "; s before us
when i can touch him and hear him
you "; re always full of doubts without any cause
no cause to doubt that a dead man can come back to life
no cause
i can take you now to talk with a man who was dead
the master brought him back to life
thomas knows him well
come , talk to him
let him tell you
you needn "; t be afraid
lazarus ? will you come to us
here "; s someone wants to question you
come in
i "; ll leave you with him
you can ask him whatever you like
they told me death is not .... ls not death
they brought me here to see because you could make me believe it
because you were dead , and were raised from the dead by the man
i mean the master
that is true
i was dead
and i know that he is christ the son of god who has power over life and death
what "; s it like there
you were there
-tell me what it "; s like
-like
-like ? -yes , what is it this thing you experienced
what is it
i have experienced nothing
only death
and death is nothing
nothing
no
what should it be
you want me to tell you about the realm of the dead
i cannot
how would you tell an unborn child what life is
it exists
but it isn "; t anything
to those who "; ve been there nothing else is anything either
no one has asked me this before
they have listened how life came back to me and gone away praising
only you have asked about death
and none the wiser
we "; re two men who might be dead
sharing his body
life
love one another
listen , everybody
that "; s the word
love one another
we can tell them about loving one another
-leave me alone. i want to sit
-what do you want to do , sit and think
it "; s no good thinking
come on , let "; s go and find a new life
-where are you going , barabbas
-to see what "; "; brought back to life "; "; means
love one another
-come on
-my shoe
look
-hey ! get up
come on
-leave it alone
stay alive
it "; s all you have to do
it "; s not my fault they let him get killed
you can "; t hang it around my neck
i "; ve as much right to be alive as any of you
you stinking fish
you "; re afraid to look at me because i "; m alive
it may be today that the new world comes
today or tomorrow
but it will come , you will see
every day you have promised us , it has never come
-lt will never come
-lt will come. i know it
please , rachel , tell us again what it will be like
you "; d better mind what you say
don "; t you know what can happen to you if they hear you
anybody now caught spreading such stories the son of god , the messiah and such , is to be judged an enemy of the state and stoned until he "; s dead
it will be as though the earth has become like a star burned clean
everything evil swept away
we shall look up and there will be angels coming down from the sky and they will put food in front of us and perhaps new clothes to wear
white , like their own
or some blue , like the color of the sky
pain and sorrow will sink into the ground , and everything will be made new because the son of god has risen from the dead
the world has become his kingdom
there "; s no truth in any of it
i know this woman
she doesn "; t know the difference between what is real and what she dreamed in her sleep
don "; t you listen to her
she "; s raking up trouble
nothing but trouble
trouble for you if you won "; t turn and listen to the sounds that have come
he knows but is afraid to believe it
look at you , barabbas
how can you see or hear what "; s to come
it will happen , whether you take part in it or not
he "; s right. lt "; s dangerous talk
they "; ll pull down our homes , drive us out
better listen to this man
-let "; s hear what the prophet said
-don "; t leave
where are you going
to where the lepers are , to tell them to be ready for the freedom that "; s coming
-she "; s going among the lepers
-stop her
she "; s going to set the lepers free
-don "; t let her go among the lepers
-don "; t let her set the lepers free
you have no right to go among the lepers
look out , it "; s a temple guard
we don "; t want the lepers to be free
a charge has been lodged against this woman
-she must be questioned
-we heard she preaches blasphemy
bring her to the temple and we will judge her
-take your dirty hands off her
-don "; t take her ! she "; s done no wrong
don "; t take her away
rachel
for blasphemy , and spreading blasphemy , this woman is condemned
for stirring up evil matters among the people for misleading their minds and denying the wisdom of authority
for her sins , she has been condemned to death by stoning
let the man who accused her and was found just in his accusation cast the first stone
what must i do
take this stone
come on
why should i throw
-l "; ve nothing against her
-you accused her
-the law gives you the first stone
-lt was you
or you "; ll find yourself there beside her
throw quickly. lf you wait , i may be afraid
you don "; t have to think of barabbas any more
he "; s not coming back
and if he did , we "; d know what to do with him
you "; re still afraid of him because he used to roar at you like a brass bull
you can "; t stand up to him even when he "; s gone
he "; s gone to the devil once and for all , i can tell you
he "; s lost his nerve
he "; s creeping about the city like a shivering priest
why do you think he "; s not come back
because he "; s afraid to stir hand or foot
-we don "; t know yet , he won "; t come back
-who cares if he does
we got a man here who can hang him in his own guts
he came out of that prison mad
acquitted but mad
we "; ll soon see it then
so , you remembered the way to get here
given you up this past week
you "; ll find things altered
what "; s over is over
i remembered the way
bring them across
god "; s curse on you
the money is sacred ! it belongs to the temple
-the god of battle will destroy you
-blasphemy
you hypocrites. i "; ll kill you both
what are you doing
here "; s all the treasure we wanted. come away
i "; ll kill you the way you had her killed
it seemed to me at the time , barabbas , when you were given your liberty before it wasn "; t a fortunate exchange
they were calling for death and disorder when they called your name
this is what i thought and this is what has occurred
they put the scourge back into the fist
by that i mean you and your life
and many men have suffered and died in consequence
the other man , too
they "; re dying because of that
this is a local matter , which i hope will soon be adjusted
the shock and fear of an unreasoning fanaticism will pass
but the appetite to destroy which , alas , the human being shares with the wild beast , is always with us
and it has rigorously to be disciplined in the name of civilization
- ... and according to the law
-that "; s what you say
but i tell you , whichever side of the law we "; re on , we "; re the same men

and have been called the glory of the earth for doing it
you were born according to the law and raised according to the law
i was born by a girl thrown out of a brothel who gave birth and cursed me before she died
but i tell you , we belong to the same herd
unfortunately for you , barabbas , the law is indispensable
the law is the pass and permit to life in this world
you were without it
however , the law here tells me that a man released by the will of the people at a holy festival cannot thereafter be given a capital punishment
you can "; t kill me
easier on you if we could
i sentence you to transportation for life , whatever that "; s worth to the sulfur mines on the island of sicily

what could kill it
when you think it was god "; s will come to earth to show what he is
i can see the reality of that
which is why the name of the master goes on growing in the world
i began to meet it wherever i sailed
phoenicia , cyprus , greece
even at the port of rome
i began to understand what it meant
but it "; s a tough demand , the will of god
i "; m a poor hand at it
and look where l "; ve got us now
even though i "; ve got his sign scratched on the back of the emperor "; s head
it means i belong to him , not to the emperor

yes , i trust it
it has to be hard going or else how will the strength come that god has wanted
god should make himself plain or leave me alone

-when shall we go

how wretched to arrive when all have gone to the mountains
look over there
well , here we have to leave your luck to learn its business
what do you mean
why do we come here
they cannot fight yet. they must first learn the skill
and so they will
but here we have to deliver them over
let "; s hope they won "; t disgrace us
when a charmed life turns professional , we can expect great things
flacus , the commander
you honor rome and us
our happiness is all here , commander
the emperor has given him his freedom three times
there "; s the third staff of liberty in his hand

he knows his empire and has the sense to keep it

he "; s taken a fair toll of them
torvald , the senator rufio and his lady

now , start your practice

you move on
bring out the first group of gladiators
you remember me
you drew the sign of the master beside my plate
how did you know i carried the sign
several days i "; ve watched you breaking the bread
can we speak freely
he was there in jerusalem. he knew the master
god be praised and keep you safe
the days have been getting darker for us
persecution increasing
the emperor wants to destroy every trace of us
but tomorrow , when the games are over and the sun is down discipline will be lax and there may be a chance for me to lead you to where we meet
the master "; s disciple , peter , is here in rome
seldom enough i find my way there , some way off to the catacombs
the catacombs
surely it "; s the dead who meet there
it may seem to you that the faith is buried
but so is the seed before there can be a harvest
first group , assemble
you shall see tomorrow the life we keep there
first group , assemble
-did you hear him , barabbas
-l heard
one , two , one , two
to your fighting places
go
when you "; ve taken up these positions tomorrow the trumpets will sound
and from above you , there the white cloth will be thrown into the arena
when it touches the ground , the contest will begin
to make sure you understand , this is the way it will happen
kill him
kill him
-that "; s an angry crowd
-they want blood
they were driven to a frenzy by sahak , who wouldn "; t kill his man
if the emperor were here , he wouldn "; t have had a choice
wait till tomorrow
he "; ll get his quota of killing , if you "; re lucky to win
-not one life will he get from me
-won "; t he
say that to the emperor
he will teach you the ways
-when he says death , death it is
-the true god says life
-l only answer to him
-hark at this man
by god , if he contradicts the emperor
-who do you call your god
-the only one
the rest are inventions of fear , tales taken from the past they can no more help you than this breast can bleed
put "; em down
-insulting the gods before we go fight
-what revenge will mars take
none at all. he doesn "; t exist
mars doesn "; t exist
what do you mean , he doesn "; t exist
will you keep your mouth shut
the real god is greater than any man "; s thoughts can imagine
he made life as deep and strong as the sea
your gods are as shallow as a reeking pond
he "; s above us and around us , in us
like the breath in our bodies
and he has one law that will break our pattern
the law is love
whatever we do that breaks that law condemns us
and so that we should see what his love is he sent his son to live the life of a man
to show that god understands the life he has made
-who spun you this
-what do you want us to do
what good will he do us in the arena
we "; ll lose the goodwill of the gods we know
tomorrow in the arena , show the emperor that we know what life "; s worth
throw away your weapons
do you think all the things of the earth and the heavens have been made for no other reason except we should eat and make money and spawn children and kill and die
what a purpose for creation
if anything "; s beyond belief , that is
god said , "; "; burn away the old world
and let a new one rise from the ashes
as the son of god rose from the dead , he died for us
ask barabbas here the truth of what i tell you
he saw with his own eyes the son of god when he lived among us
saw him die
was there , in the garden , on the third morning
you saw him , barabbas
-tell us what you saw
-what happened
a long time ago i saw a man
some people say he was
- ... the son of god
-enough
you "; ve condemned yourselves
i charge you with sedition and stirring up mutiny
you "; re both under arrest
take them out and put them in chains
move now
let me be sure you understand the seriousness of the charge against you
not only with holding views proscribed by the state for which the punishment is death , but of recommending those views to men sworn to the state "; s service
what is more , you "; ve betrayed your faith to me who brought you to this city and laid me under possible suspicion of connivance in the eyes of the emperor
the prospect is black for you
you know what this is
-the stamp of the roman state
-which means that you "; re rome "; s property
what "; s this cut here
the sign of my master
-who do you call your master
-the one who is my lord
-the son of the father
-ln other words , the christian sign
a religion which sets itself up to menace government and order
which denies the divine authority of the emperor
which preaches that the slave is equal to the free man and would reduce society to anarchy
a rebellious , insufferable doctrine
give me a direct answer
do you belong to the state
i belong to the lord , my god
so , you also believe in this god
tell me , do you
you don "; t
then why do you bear his name on your disc
isn "; t he your god
isn "; t that what the inscription means
i have no god
i don "; t understand
why then do you bear this sign of jesus christ , scratched on your disc
because i tried to believe
i "; ll give you the opportunity to recover your senses
if you "; ll admit publicly to the men you spoke to that all these things were lies , you may save your life
will you do this
that would be to lose my life , not save it
what i am is his
but isn "; t life dear to you
yes , it is
and you understand the cruel death that punishes mutiny and sedition
what do you choose
i choose my god
then there is no more i can do for you
guilty of the charge. execution at sunrise
you "; re as mad as your god
you , come here
unwise to carry around with you what you don "; t believe in
it may be the master means you to live
he may have some greater need of you
some other purpose , barabbas
-something else
-take him away
guards
now you "; ll have to be worth two men to take his place
you may go
you are to witness the punishment of this man so that there can be no doubt in your mind that the words he spoke to you were a gross breach of the law
an iniquitous crime against the state
not only lies , but treasonable lies which were not only aimed at spreading rebellion among you but also to pervert your minds from those acceptable religions on which the state is built
any man who thinks that those words are harmless or thinks that he can repeat or conform to such words as this man spoke let him take warning from the punishment you are about to witness
long live the emperor
proceed , torvald

traitors and fools
you "; ll wish this was better done
kill him

gladiator barabbas , you "; re becoming quite a legend among us , i hear
for your remarkable persistence in life we have a traditional answer to this public acclaim
we make you a free man
we give you your liberty
here is the symbol of your freedom
i brought him to you
this is where he would have wanted to be buried
our brother sahak
so you had to carry your dead conscience here
did he have to die before you cared about him
are you more concerned with his body than his life
you were willing to let him go to his death alone
why should you help him now he doesn "; t need you
how could i have helped him by being killed
he made his own death
what good has it done
i had to go on living , he said
-there was something i still had to do
-barabbas , why should you believe it
when the light shone , you wouldn "; t accept it
when the dark came , you denied it
when the spirit of god beckoned , you refused it
when sahak says your life is kept for some purpose why should you believe it
to make a gag for your conscience , is that it
you believe it because it suits you
or maybe if sahak stood before you now then you would say you believed. you would repent and love god
it would be easy
but what strength would your belief have then
what would it matter
jesus of nazareth was killed instead of me
there must have been a reason
why me
why did he choose me
where have you gone
you
where are you
wait for me
wait
you wait
for god "; s sake , where are you

is it true
were you setting fire to a storehouse
yes
-we "; ve never seen you before
-who are you
my name is barabbas
-barabbas , the robber
-barabbas , the acquitted
this burning city is no work of ours
this isn "; t how the new kingdom is going to be made
you were wrong
who are you to tell me i "; m wrong
many years ago we spoke together
you remember
no
you asked me why i was making a net so far from the sea
jerusalem
the street of the potters
you were mistaken of us then as you are again now
we didn "; t set fire to the city
you "; ve done the work of the wild beast , the emperor
-are you a lunatic
-lt was his fire , you fool , not god "; s
why can "; t god make himself plain
what "; s become of all the fine hopes
the trumpets , the angels
all the promises
every time i "; ve seen it end up the same way , with torments and dead bodies with no good come of it
all for nothing
do you think they persecute us to destroy nothing
or do you think that what has battered on your soul for twenty years has been nothing
it wasn "; t for nothing that christ died
mankind isn "; t nothing
in his eyes , each individual man is the whole world
he loves each man as though there were no other
i was the opposite of everything he taught , wasn "; t l
why did he let himself be killed instead of me
because being farthest from him , you were the nearest
-l "; m no nearer than i was before
-nor any farther away
the truth of the matter is , he "; s never moved from your side
i can tell you this
there has been a wrestling in your spirit , back and forth in your life which in itself is knowledge of god. by the conflict you have known him
i can tell you as well , that so it will be with the coming of the kingdom
that wrestling back and forth and the laboring of the world spirit like a woman in childbirth
we are only the beginning
we won "; t see the time when the earth is full of the kingdom
and yet , even now , even here we are at the end ourselves
the kingdom is within us
there is nothing more to fear
upon us , the years will be built
many years , many martyrdoms
the ground of men is very stubborn to mature
but men will look back to us in our day and will wonder and remember our hope
it is the end of the day
we shall trust ourselves to a little pain and sleep

somnambulism
a collected edition by the university of upsala
his specialty
the cabinet of dr. caligari
in the year 1783 , a mystic by the name of caligari toured the fairs of numerous villages in northern italy , accompanied by a somnambulist named cesare
for months he sowed panic amongst village folks through a series of foul murders committed under almost identical circumstances he had entirely subjugated to his will a somnambulist named cesare , whom he did compel to carry out his nefarious schemes
a puppet , the exact likeness of cesare , and which took his place in a cabinet , allowed him to divert any suspicion that might fall on the somnambulist
my diary
12 march ... finally ... finally
a somnambulist has been brought to the asylum for admission
afternoon - my desire
i shall be able to satisfy my life 's unwavering wish
now i shall unravel the psychiatric secrets of this caligari
now i shall discover if it is true that a somnambulist can be compelled to perform acts that in a walking state he would never commit and would be repugnant to him
whether it is true that a sleepwalker can be led to commit even murder
an obsession
i must know everything
i must penetrate his secrets
i must become caligari
you must become caligari
end of act v
act vi
we found the sleepwalker out in the fields
mr. director - unmask yourself
you are dr. caligari
and from that day on , the madman never again left his cell
look ... there 's cesare ... never allow him to tell your fortune , or you 're dead
jane
i love you
won 't you be my wife at last
we queens are not free to answer the call of our heart
you all think that - i 'm insane

algol ( tragedy of power
algol prologue
high and far away shines the star algol , the mystery of the sky
from time immemorial to this day , the star dims every third night at 10 and shines again the fourth night
the greek astrologers called it the demon
the arab sky scholars called it algol , the demon 's eye
deep inside , the children of the day break coal exhaling hot gases
the worker robert herne
three hours , robert , and we start a new day
never comes the day , maria obal
my day is where you are , robert
on that day , leonore nissen becomes greater age and , as sole heir of his father , she receives from her tutors the coal mine
i thank my tutors and directors for the faithful service when i take the direction of the mine
my first priority will be those who are working for me far from the light of day
i want to go down today
i come to you as a sister
there is no alternative for us
once again , the light of algol faded
deep within the mountain , the demon 's gallery abandoned and avoided for bad conditions
my name is algol
i 'm the new replacement worker and i came here to report to you
all those who work for me will be my guests tomorrow a day of joy in the sunlight. from the mountains on my way home , i 'm deeply moved by what i saw
i want this to be proclaimed in every house in the mining town and in all wells and tunnels
my new replacement worker , algol
he doesn 't have a shelter
... if you allow it and accept , he could live in the attic
this is my home , inherited from my parents
welcome
tomorrow , at break time
peter hell , a childhood friend of robert and mary
all those who work for me will be my guests tomorrow a day of joy in the sunlight. from the mountains on my way home , i 'm deeply moved by what i saw
charity
should we think as bad as you
bye
i 'm not going to the party
i 'm going to travel
the lovely lady is very generous
tell me all about those people
from their fears to their wishes and what they think
i 'm not a toy for your whims
i 'm not kidding
i bring all that i have
if there is any way to take me to your world , i won 't get there by taking your hand
i 'll bring her home , she isn 't well
i fear for us , robert
once i would have saved a person like her
give me a light , robert
i want to read my books
and robert didn 't find peace
a thousand roads lead to the light
don 't be afraid , algol will take you away from the troubles of the night
it will be yours the earth 's might
algol takes you away from the troubles of the night
only a year and you 'll rule the world
to my assistant in the hour of my death
doctor crane
from the star algol to the earth
no one knows , no one knew before me of these waves
with my little machine i detected them for the first time
which were intensified with the power of the whole world

the stars reveal to the revered rabbi low that the jewish community is threatened by severe harm
i must speak with rabbi jehuda , our people are facing an impending calamity
summon all the community elders , so they will pray at the temple to jehova throughout the night
disaster is written in the stars
we will no longer ignore the many serious charges brought up against the jews. they crucified our lord , capably disregard the holy christian festivities , lust for the property and blood of their fellow men , and are able to use black magic
hence we decree that all jews evacuate their quarter known as the ghetto before the new moon
squire florian , you must deliver our edict to the jewish quarter immediately
venus is entering the libran constellation
the time has come for the invocation to be successful
to save my people i must wrest the crucial life-giving word from the dreaded spirit astaroth , that will bring the golem to life
an envoy from the emperor is waiting outside
if there is any compassion within your young heart , you will accompany me to revered rabbi low
he incarnates the heart and voice of our jewish community
i was the one who drew up the emperor 's horoscope , and twice i have warned him of danger

come to the rose festival at the castle and amuse us again with your magic arts
soon you will have a guardian
this figure named the "; go / em "; was created in classical times by a thessalonian sorcerer
if the life-awakening word is placed in the amulet on his chest , he will be alive as long as he wears it
this symbol is called the "; shem
who could know the word
necromancie
the art of bringing dead beings to life
astaroth is the guardian of a life-giving word that will awaken any and everything , whether corpse or man 's creation. whoever possesses the key of solomon and knows the "; great spell
can compel astaroth to reveal the word insofar as he awaits an auspicious constellation of celestial bodies
the hour has come
astaroth
astharoth , appear ! appear
name the word
on behalf of the lord of the spirits , name the word
the word , that terrible life-giving word. i have snatched it from the evil , dark powers that be
i shall now call the golem to life
end of chapter two chapter three a strange servant
that 's my new servant
golem 's first errand
he is the rabbi 's new servant , who is mute
he will come here every day in my stead , from now on
give him always everything on the list and he will do you no harm
i have been invited to the castle today
you will mind the house
the golem comes with me , as i want to show him to the emperor
the festival of roses
when your father arrives at the castle i will steal away from the festival
i have bribed the gatekeeper
place a lamp in the window as a sign that you are waiting for me
he is my servant and my creation
he is called golem. i cannot say any more than this
what a phantasmagoria you are displaying before our eyes , you strange illusionist
let us see more of your arts
let me show you our jewish forefathers , o mighty emperor , so you better come to know our people
but there is a requirement : nobody is allowed to speak a word or to laugh. othennise a terrible calamity can happen
ahasverus , the wandering jew
save me and i will pardon your people
end of chapter three chapter four
the emperor has pardoned all jews , we are saved
awaken our sleeping brothers with the joyous sounds of the shofar
i know it for sure ! the watchman told me himself
revered rabbi low has returned from the emperor , bearing the pardon
if you brought an inanimate being to life through magic , beware of your creation
when uranus enters the house of the planets , astaroth will reclaim his instrument
then the lifeless clay will turn against the master , intent on deceit and destruction
golem , your task is accomplished
once again become dead clay , as you have been before. othennise the dark power will have its vengeance
master , master
revered rabbi low
jehuda is waiting below with the community elders to escort you to the temple for prayer of thanks
as soon as everyone will be at the temple , you can sneak away
mirjam has not heard yet. she is sleeping
i cannot open the door now , just go ahead
no , no , i will wait
i want to accompany you to the temple
a strange man is inside her chamber
chase him away

the demon
the demon takes mirjam away with him
he will annihilate everything
save us , rabbi
recite the fire spell or we shall all perish
the revered rabbi low has saved our people for the second time
let us all gather at the gate to thank him there
revered rabbi low , the people are all coming
thank you for exorcising the fire
can you forgive me
the rabbi 's house lies ruined in ashes , and every trace of the stranger has been extinguished
no one suspects anything and i will keep quiet
the golem , the golem
where is the golem

twenty seven years later
san francisco is the richest city in the western world
she has one hideous blemish
the barbary coast
barbary nell
frisco pete
blizzard , lord and master of the underworld
lichtenstein , of the federal secret service
rose , his most daring operative
rose , this detail i 'm offering you is so dangerous , i hope you will turn it down
it ' s always blizzard , that cripple from hell
do you remember sweet barbary nell who wandered from our fold
she ' s dead
i could get him for theft , arson , murder , but his criminal machine would still grind on
through the master i must reach his slave , the underground powers of the reds
he ' s gathered up his dance hall girls and he ' s put them to work in his house , making hats , thousands of hats
i must know why
i believe blizzard is hatching something so big , it endangers the city
i must find out what
by the way , barbary nell , who strayed from us , now sleeps upon a marble stab in the morgue
blizzard ' s favorite for the moment
a woman who enters that den risks worse than death
that ' s all in the day ' s work
and i shall walk as men walk
i shall be the master of a city
and for my mangled years the city shall pay me with the pleasures of a nero and the powers of a caesar
but you won ' t live to see it ... if you don ' t pedal better
it means living in that devil ' s house till you find out what he ' s up to
of course
well , i ' m game
dr. ferris , now the most famous surgeon in his line
dr. wilmot allen , his assistant
blizzard had agents in strange places
barbara asked me to call for her
the surgeon ' s daughter barbara , had dedicated herself to art
i ' m dreadfully discouraged
i have done nothing worth while
some day she will realize that this is all nonsense
sorry you have to go
haven ' t i waited long enough
why don ' t you chuck it , barbara
not until i have done at least one thing that is worth doing
and i ' m going to do satan , after the fall
if i fail i will marry you
nothing to report
blizzard keeps plans to himself
his people obey orders not knowing their meaning. my knowledge of music has been my protection
he likes my pedaling
rose has been there a week
and she ' s learned nothing
you ' re a find
you are not afraid of me
you look me in the eyes
how could i be afraid
when you play like that
you are a find
wanted
- model to pose of "; satan after the fall
if you thing look like satan , apply at studio of barbara ferris , 32 institute place
be in front of that studio tomorrow and see that no applicant but myself enters it
everything comes to him who waits
you have mangled this poor child for life
do i look like satan
before i am through with her and her father , they ' think i ' m the devil himself
9 a.m , barbara ' s studio at 32 institute place
model already engaged
bubbles , a street waif whom barbara has befriended
whenever blizzard was absent , rose hunted for clues
some excellent judges think that i resemble satan
if there is enough of me
i seem to please
i knew about when i was bumming the streets cat-throat ' s his middle name
you ought not touch him with a pole
gawd
look at that face
if i could catch that expression in the day ... i ' d be famous
how do you happen to know so much about art
my father , who shall be nameless , was a distinguished man
but he detested little boys with their legs clipped off
so at fifteen i hoppled out of his life
i could write a better treatise on sculpture myself
why do you live in the underworld
when satan fell from heaven he looked for power in hell
hugely satisfied with his morning s work
rose , my dear
under the piano my darling
we will have some music
i have a feeling i shall waft you into heaven
a death song , rose
rose was my best bet
so far she ' s learned nothing
i could not have played that way without your help
go back to work
i can murder anything but music
days passed and the clay grew into the image of the man who was like satan
into a face clothed with evil intent
in time man would mangle the soul of the daughter , even as the father had mangled the body of the man
the end of this passage is barred by a gate but through it i could see what
but the most remarkable of all is a fully-equipped operating room
if you say it ' s good , i know it ' s good
but she hesitated for this would mean the end of blizzard
i know of dr. allen
and of his great master , dr. ferris
i will come tomorrow at the same time
what an admirable pair of legs
i gave mine to science
that monster ought to be chloroformed and put out of the way
he shows me only courtesy and helpfulness
the end of this passage is barred by a gate , but through it i could see what
doctor ferris investigates
may i talk with mr. blizzard alone
i have followed every step of your career , and you have indeed profited by your early mistakes
you were the child whose life i ruined
don ' t let that trouble you too deeply
it is now in your power to repair your error
command me in any way
but don ' t come here any more
only your daughter ' s request can keep me away
she is making a masterpiece
barbara , let me tell you a story
he lies
he did not have to cut them off
behind his visits there is some sinister motive
i can read it his eyes
if you have made him what he is , it is all the more our duty to help him
blizzard ' s man o 'hagan , his back in town
he has organized thousands of disgruntled foreign laborers
hats and men ... what ' s the devil up to
blizzard ' s chief lieutenant , o 'hagan
you have worked in the dark long enough ... this is the plan i have been developing for two years
2 december
at twelve noon on that day i shall loot the city of san francisco
your 10.000 foreign malcontents will filter into the city in small detachments
the signal will be an explosion
by fire and riots i shall draw the police and military into the suburbs
the heart of the city will be left defenseless
ours to loot at will
and then we shall vanish with our treasure
you talk as if you had legs
by god
you have gone mad
perhaps ... but with the madness that succeeds
better come out of that closet or i will begin to shoot
crying won ' t help
talking may
what the use ... you ' re going kill me anyhow
i doubt it
you ' re the best pedaler i ever had
but the most remarkable of all is a fully equipped operating room
you see , you haven ' t been allowed to do much damage
i think i ' m glad
don ' t you see
master
with exultation he felt the power that his mind was gaining over barbara
you are the best critic in the world
live your own life ... go where i shall point ... to your place among the stars
how am i ever going to thank you the help you have given me
when you have finished that , don ' t give me op
i love you , barbara , with my whole heart and soul
at her laugh his hell - born loose passions broke
but almost instantly he knew that he had blundered and like a good general tried retrieve his mistake
i am the unhappiest beast in the world
forgive me having dared to lift my thoughts to you
laughter burns a cripple like acid
i don ' t know why i laughed
you frightened me
will you forgive me
i have come to prescribe a little , barbara
call me a taxi
true women need love , a home , children
he has made you forget that
i will marry you , dear , whenever you wish
after a night of jealous fury , the beast takes action
hello doctor , this is bubbles
it ' s about barbara
she ' s gone to blizzard ' s house
i do not know why she went
she was crying
he will run all the way
on those magnificent legs
once before a woman surfeited me with her caresses
she ' s dead
rose just shows herself at the window and nods ... and that ' s all
where is miss ferris
she is probably in her room
shall i search your house , or will you take me to her
listen , my baffled hero
if you wish the lady to go free you must hand over to me your superb legs
dr. ferris will cut them off for you
then he will graft them to me
they will be very becoming
your daughter is in my house
she has been hurt
cowmen at once
that fairy tale about your daughter was merely to make certain that you ' d come
you ' ve played the trick with apes ... now i ' m putting human beings at your service
your victim is fulfilling destiny in making you the master surgeon of the world
you must make it possible
unless you would have your charming daughter married to these
out of my house is not out of my power ... that ' s here
suppose you and your assistant should disappear ... then your daughter and i
give me legs and i will be a model son-in-law
then i will be a tower of strength
i will be a caesar
you are right
you ' d be a superman
i will do it
doctor ferris ' sudden decision to operate brought about starling results
i have waked from a terrible dream
i was a devil
i did things that i shudder to think of
what ' s happened
you did not do what he wanted
that was a madman ' s request
i operated on his head
there is a contusion at the base of the skull
that caused pressure on the brain ... he has never been wholly responsible for his acts
this man , let alone may become as great a power for good as he was for evil
he shall have the chance
the tyrant ' s hand relaxed
the whirlwind breaks
ôhe old blizzard is no more
i have assumed my real name
in my madness i built power from evil
i shall undo my handwork
i am still your friend , but it must be for better things
he ' s got religion
that means he will raise hell
how do we know he won ' t snitch on us
if we don ' t finish him , he will finish us
the new man ... and his wife
we shall do great things together
fate chained me to evil
for that i must pay the penalty
that is a great puzzle , perhaps i am going to see it solved
don ' t grieve , dear
death interests me
all that ' s left of him
an evil mask of a great soul
the end
now , as a thousand years ago , the waterfall sings by the old norwegian village
if we listen closely , it tells a lot about the days gone by
hear , o hear my voice proclaim
come all ye from far and near
i summon you to elect a parson. for we have no good shepherd here
these two had wandered over the mountain from a neighboring parish
sofren had struggled through long student days and now he was applying for the vacant post
mari had waited faithfully during all the hard years
mari reminds sofren that her father will not allow them to marry until sofren is truly a parson
sofren 's two rivals to the post had faith in their handsome clothes and the fine learning that was crammed into them in copenhagen
each of the three candidates wished heartily for the devil himself to take away the others
in the beginning , man , unlike others creatures , was made in the image of god
but we must consider why it was that god made man so perfect and magnificent
i am going to speak to you about balaam 's ass and god 's strange power --- by which he was able to open the jaws of a dumb animal so that it might speak like a man
now , two learned applicants have appeared here before me
one of them took us to eden
and that is as far back as we can go
let him stay there
the other one chose the text
am i not an ass ? but what has an ass to do on the pulpit
my friends , i will not take you to eden --- you are too clever
but i will take you to the bowels of the earth , deep in the roaring jaws of hell
and so , my friends , beware that you are not swallowed up by the roaring jaws of hell
the congregation had appointed five wise and trusted men to pass verdicts on the applicants
when the two theologians from copenhagen saw they could not reach their goal by words alone , they joined forces to invite everyone to a feast that evening
out of common decency , they were obliged to invite sofren too
at last , the verdict was sofren
according to the law of our parish , the late parson 's widow , dame margarete , claims the right to demand that his successor marry her
since dame margarete insists on her right , we have asked her to come here tonight so the candidate may have a look at her
night has fallen already
will you do me the honor to accompany me to the parsonage
sofren had heard that dame margarete might be a witch
but he did not feel it would do him any harm just to enter the house
my lot is not an easy one
this the fourth time i must be handed over like a piece of furniture to whomever claims me
but i am attached to this place , to every chair and candlestick
and if you part with what has become so important to your life , your innermost heart gets torn open
and you die
you are not engaged to any young maiden , are you
i hope that you will accept my hospitality
it is dark and long way to the inn
the next morning , sofren woke up late
never in his life had he been so well dressed
he wore a black coat and breeches that had been put beside his bed
i had the most wonderful sleep last night
i felt i was resting in abraham 's bosom
indeed ... there i have never slept
in front of him lay a gleaming white herring
he was drawn to it as if by a magic power
dame margarete 's two old servants had been with her as long as anyone could remember
after sofren had eaten the fat herring and emptied the bottle of schnapps , he felt very strange
as if in a fog , he saw dame margarete , not old and ugly , but as a young smiling girl
dame margarete , i love you
let me stay here with you always
isn 't it so , master sofren , that you offered me your heart and hand and asked me to be your wife
of course you will have your freedom
you have your room and i have mine
i only wish to stay and manage everything as before
sofren , how could you
how did the widow bewitch you
with a herring she gave me
it made me so dizzy that i proposed to her
i cannot get you if i do not get the post , and i will not get that unless i wed the old woman
but after she dies , i inherit everything
then we can marry
can dame margarete really not see who it is
why , it is my sister mari
she is so unhappy at having to leave me
i beg you to let mari live at the parsonage in return for help around the house
do you think the old woman will be done for soon
a few weeks later , a neighboring parson joined the two in wedlock
even though both bride and bridegroom preferred a quiet ceremony , it was the custom in the area to hold a big celebration
we will now drink to the health of the bridal couple and wish them a long and happy life
the day after the wedding. sofren made up for it
in the future. i suggest you and your companions be less high and mighty
for i am master of this house
master sofren is too big for his boots
give him a drubbing
i suggest you concentrate on prayers and sermons
do not play master here
i am master of this house
time passed by
dame margarete had not yet died and sofren had not been able to see mari alone
it was not the only time that sofren was unlucky
oh
the parson cast amorous glances at me
let the fine fellow go
i will have you know i am a decent girl
sofren was at his wit 's end
finally he stooped to courting at night just as peasant lads did
i had a sudden stomachache and was just going to ask my sister for some drops
if you need drops , you had better come to me
sofren would not give up
a night or two later he tried again
my little popsy
shame , that you cannot leave us girls alone
one evening they sat together all three , working
do you know what country folk say about you , dame margarete
that you got your former husband through black magic
i also wonder a good deal about that herring you gave me --- was it real
no , it had a spell cast upon it
and they say you have a potion which can prolong one 's life
it must be the truth ... just look at me
i will live for at least another hundred years
a few nights later the full moon came shining into dame margarete 's chamber
never have i seen the like
the devil himself walking in the pastor 's slippers
a couple of hours went by but dame margarete held out bravely
so that is how the devil looks
sofren did one stupid trick after another
however , one day something happened of the greatest importance to everybody
shouldn 't you prepare your sunday sermon instead of idling here
sofren hoped dame margarete would stay up in the loft and mayby in the meantime he could meet mari
but mari was where sofren least expected
be careful , dame margarete
the ladder is gone
the thigh-bone is broken and she suffered a concussion
but she will recover
several weeks passed before sofren was allowed to enter the sickroom
during this time , sofren truly grew fond of dame margarete , who nursed little mari day and night as tenderly as a mother
i am reminded of my youth
my first husband and i were engaged for many years when he applied for the post here and learned he could have it only if he wedded the parson 's widow
we knew that the widow was weak and could scarcely live long
it was a sore temptation to us
yes , god forgive us
we built our happiness on the hope of another 's death
five years we had to wait
but these rooms hold memories of thirty happy years , and in the churchyard is a grave that is never out of my thoughts
forgive us , dame margarete
mari and i are not sister and brother --- she is my fiancee
we have also waited for your death , dame margarete
poor children
poor children
not long afterwards , mari was on her feet again --- thanks to dame margarete 's tender care
but dame margarete now spent half the day in the churchyard by her first husband 's grave
one morning at breakfast , dame margarete was missing
do not forget , when my mortal remains are taken away , to put a horseshoe over the door and to strew linseed after me so that i shall not haunt you
a week later the funeral took place
i render thanks for all the good i have known in my days
my voice i raise by tones of bells in praise of the lord of lords
to call god 's folk to church and now to sound a burial hymn
following her own wish , dame margarete was buried with her first husband
we owe her a great debt , mari. she taght you to keep a good home , and she taught me to be a honorable man

i must talk with the captain of the storm bird as soom as possible our search here for the buddha-head diamond was in vain
in one of the chinese shops above the subterranean city
the guards of chinatown
the gambling rooms of the red dragon
the buddha-head diamond is not in the city otherwise we would have found it
the diamonds were of no value ti us
part of the proceeds from their sale was deposited in a joint account , and part
i 'll stay another two days until the initial excitement in over then in the evening i was board the storm bird and we can sail immediately
kay hoog is here
release the woman and you are free to go
but they were not to be trusted as soon as kay hoog released her , he was overpowered and imprisoned

a hypnotic-telepathic experiment
find the buddha stone , so that asia can become great and free itself from foreign rule
a heart attack
experiment successful
in hypnotic trance , yoghi saw stone in possession of diamond magnate terry london whose ancestors stole the holy stone generations ago four-finger john will make all preparations
dear mr. hoog
here are the decoded contents of the secret document about four hundred years ago , the ming dynasty in china has in possession a diamond , which because of its peculiar shape resembled the head of buddha
this stone was stolen and , so the story goes , asia will free itself from foreign tyranny when a princess brings this stone back to asia
change course
head for england
john terry , the diamond magnate , and his daughter ellen
i must leave at once on important business
mr. terry returns
the spiders have kidnapped your daughter
as ransom we demand the buddha-head diamond
you will hear from us
the next day
extra
special edition
5,000 pounds reward
the storm bird left the harbor tonight for an unknown destination
on board of storm bird
i don 't know what diamond you 're talking about
it seems that the solution can only be found through john terry himself
the spiders have kidnapped your daughter
as ransom we demand the buddha-head diamond
you will hear from us
i don 't know what they want from me
i have never owned such a stone
and yet the secret must lie with you
the spiders do nothing that isn 't thought out
isn 't anything known in your family about such a diamond
perhaps one of your ancestors
that 's the founder of our family fortune one of the most famous pirate captains of the sixteenth century
the logbook of the sea witch
i vaguely remember reading something in the captain 's logbook that might have been a reference to the diamond shaped like a buddha
we went ashore on the coast of the falkland islands and found our secret cache in the caves , as we had left it two years ago
a few pages in the logbook are missing here
what happened after distributing the loot i don 't know
something terrible must have happened , because the logbook says only
i was the only one who could save himself
what happened ... what catastrophe befell the unlucky sailors there is nothing in the logbook
shortly thereafter , the captain died in a battle , and his successor brought the logbook and the picture to the family
many have tried to discover the secret of the hiding place but no one has succeeded
an old map of the falkland islands
four-finger john
let 's see if we can find any clues in his room to the whereabouts of ellen
if you tell us exactly what has happened to ellen terry , we will release you and give you the reward
ellen terry was taken on board the storm bird and is sailed immediately
i don 't know its destination
we will keep you here for 48 hours , to prevent sabotage of our plans then you are free
i will try to find the stone
the fate of your daughter depends on it i will succeed or perish
stone possibly on falkland islands kay hoog on his way to find the diamond
change the course of the storm bird at once
i will force ellen terry under my will and make her the princess who will free asia from all foreign tyranny
when she wears the imperial crown , all asia will lie at our feet
a footprint
the treasure cavern
give me the buddha-head diamond
he has to have the stone
i saw it in his hand
hunger and thirst will make you talk
the poisonous crater
during the night , deadly fumes rose from the crater
weeks later , back in london
i was the only one who could save himself , and here is the stone
shortly before you arrived , i received a call from the pinkerton detective agency. they think they have found a clue to my daughter
an elderly gentlemen has registered at the royal hotel with a young woman although she is supposedly his daughter , she fits the photo of the missing girl
i have been instructed to ask you to come along and identify the girl
we must be careful not to arouse suspicion you can observe their room from here
lio sha is dead
the stone is lost forever
no one must know
for some time i have been followed by indian spies the asian committee suspects me of being a double agent since i haven 't been able to produce the stone as i had promised
there is only one way to avoid disaster
have a diamond shop cut a stone that is just like the original
that 's the only way to fool them
go to amsterdam today
spare no expense
it 's our only chance
ellen terry is under my spell
she is sleeping now
you have betrayed asia you and the woman who was going to usurp the imperial crown
your daughter appears to have been under a hypnotic spell but she 's awake now , and knows nothing of the past events

dangers of the fly "; was rendered from a 35 mm copy , very well preserved by the "; pablo ducrós hicken "; film museum
during the process , a likely correct speed for projection was estimated
dangers of the fly
the aim of this film is to disseminate to the audience a knowledge that generally remains restricted to researchers
the magnification diameters given in this film refer to the size of the image as projected on an 8 meters screen
the fly , dipterous , grows in filth , lives among men and is the carrier of many diseases
these insects have been and continue to be the object of countless scientific studies carried out by zoologists , entomologists and hygienists
these dipterous are studied in medical zoology and parasitology research laboratories from a systematic point of view
placing these insects in the zoological system
for a systematic study , zoologists begin by differentiating species within the same class
in this case brachycera
their biology ( characteristics and habits ) , and their role as carrier and transmitter of pathogenic germs
fly legs are made of hair , claws , bristles , spines and flakes that work as an outstanding conveyor of germs , microorganisms and diseases
by observing the wing veins , different types of brachycera can be classified
muscidae , tabanidae , cestriade , asilidae , etc
the proboscis , an organ for grasping and sucking the food that this insect finds in rubbish , gets loaded with germs that can immediately be placed on man 's food , skin and wounds
enlargement : 3850 diametres
in order to be studied , and without losing hair , flakes , bristles and other features that allow them to be identified , they are kepts in special jars
they are put to death using xylol , chloroform , benzine and ether gasses , etc
afterwards , they are fastened with silver , gold or other stainless metals pins and are kept in special packing jars
flies are classified by their proboscis , either inermis or pointed , depending on whether they can lacerate human and animal skin
chrysomia macellaria
vulgar name
screwworm fly
musca domestica
vulgar name
house fly
there are countless different kinds and species of inermis flies. given their similar biology , they are profanely named flies
sarcophaga carnaria
vulgar name
given that the fly legs are an excellent microorganism conveyor ... if a solid growth media is melted in a sterile , germ free capsule once it is cold , a fly is laid over it and it walks along that sanitized surface each step leaves a footprint
because the feet were in touch with filth and loaded with it , they leave germs with every step
if that capsule is placed in an oven at 37o centigrade temperature each microorganism reproduces until forming a colony of millions of bacteria
24 hours later , the capsules impregnated by the flies show that a bacteria colony has grown around each footprint
if these colonies are touched using a previously sterilized platinum applicator and a sample is spread over a sterilized glass observing it through a microscope so we can see ... a tiny drop of culture fluid
contains millions of moving bacteria , the cause of several diseases
enlargement : 35.000 diameters
dissecting a fly shows that some of the bacteria and protozoan ingested by the insect are destroyed , while others resist digestion and thus reproduce
located in the dipterous excrements , these germs can affect people and cause diseases
the events observed in the laboratory are identical to those that take place in nature
the fly rubs its head and feet while eating from the same food that human beings will eat later the wings and other parts getting rid of the germs that they are loaded with
through different procedures the fly leaves germs in all sorts of substances , like milk , stock , meat , etc , all of which constitute an excellent growth medium where germs can reproduce into millions within a few hours
through these habits , flies transmit
typhoid fever , dysentery
cholera , and other severe infections
the proboscis is covered with hair , which is an excellent microorganism transmitter
the fly , a germ carrier , can alter the properties of milk that will later be ingested by children , causing food poisoning , disease , and the death of thousands of infants
the death rate caused by intestinal diseases among the infantile population ( 0 to 3 years ) reached 8500. this indicates how dangerous they are
the following process has been described as the major cause of
poliomyelitis or infantile paralysis ... disease that kills 8900 of sick children in period of days those who survive are crippled or paralyzed for life
this disease , like brain and spinal cord meningitis , tuberculous meningitis and meningeal edema caused by intestinal intoxication are a statistical group called meningitis. our hospital treats thousands of children affected by this disease
after visiting places where excrements are disposed , the fly becomes a carrier of intestinal vermes eggs ( worms ) through the same procedure described earlier. minuscule cestoda larvae pierce the skin , reach the intestine and cause severe anemia
different protozoan like balantidiun coli and entamoeba dysenteriae cause acute dysentery
enlargement : 7000 diameters
the hematophagous fly uses its proboscis to pierce the skin and suck blood
stomoxys calcitrans
vulgar name
stable fly
tabanus mexicanus
vulgar name
horse fly
pangonia sp
some of these species transmit trypanosomiasis , also known as sleeping disease or "; mal de caderas
when men or animals are stung by this type of fly , they develop a deadly disease in a period of 9 to 10 days
through the observation of a blood sample taken from a sick animal , naturally or artificially infected red corpuscles numerous moving protozoans live and thus reproduce in the animal 's blood , causing anemia , paralysis
trypanosoma equinum ... this is the parasite that causes mal de caderas disease
tripanosoma equinum : a genus of parasitic flagellate protozoa of the family trypanosomatidae
enlargement : 350.000 diameters
musca domestica , stomoxis calcitrans and other species develop in excrement
they lay eggs in excrement , rotten meat and other organic decomposed substances , where larvae can feed on
laying eggs takes them approximately 30 minutes
this egg laying insect uses its touch sensibility to find a hidden , appropriate place to lay its eggs
enlargement : 2000 diameters
a group of 280 to 300 eggs are laid at the same time
if these eggs were placed one next to the other , they would cover a 712 square millimeters surface
using a microscope , one can see that the eggs show a longitudinal line , where they hatch
depending on the temperature conditions , hatching occurs 12 to 24 hours after the eggs are laid
enlargement : 3150 diameters
this process occurs in less than a minute . ... the new born larvae leave the egg shells
the larvae are viscous and transparent. they develop in a period of 8 to 14 days , depending on the temperature conditions and food availability
the larvae turn into 8 to 10 millimeter long , opaque white worms
once the larvae are completely developed they stop eating and moving the metamorphosis begins ... the larva turns into a pupa in 1 to 2 hours
when the pupa is totally still , its outer shell gets thick and hard. its color turns from white to brown. this process takes approximately 6 hours
the fly can hibernate in excrement until the following season. when the new season begins , the pupa breaks and a perfect insect is born
the size of a fly does not vary along its life. when it is born , its color is clear. its wings are stuck to its sides
if a fly lays approximately 300 eggs , and only half of them complet the process as described earlier , the following summer there will be
1stoctober : 1 fly 1st november : 150 flies
if this amount lays eggs during this period 22.934.144.295.301 flies
if you kill a fly , you are killing 22 trillion dangerous insects
there are countless procedures to exterminate flies
the most successful and the one with best results in practice , is to create a hostile environment for this dipterous
demonstration
a capsule containing excrements ( no1 ) and another capsule containing excrements and lime at 1000 ( no2 ) are exposed to flies
8 to 10 days later , there is a large amount of larvae in the first capsule ( no1 ) while no larvae has grown in the second capsule ( no2
every means at our disposal to exterminate flies are useful
insecticide is as deadly to flies as machine guns are to men
a mix of : milk 100 grams , sugar 1 tablespoon , formol 1 tablespoon this is an effective fly-killing candy
fly paper and different traps
all of these devices are highly effective

a tale told in living pictures under the direction of victor sjöström
at the camera : j. julius
once there was a poor salvation army sister at death 's door
she was stricken with galloping consumption , and she had only held out for the space of a year
when there was no hope left she had gone home to her mother
waiting at the foot of her bed was another salvation army sister who had once worked alongside the sick girl
don 't fret over those poor souls now , sister edit
you have done enough for them
send for david holm
please don 't
my daughter was yours as long as she had a spark of life
let me have her to myself now that she is dying
slster maria , why don 't you do as i ask
send for david holm
l shall go fetch him at once
you can 't be serious , asking david holm to attend a death bed
l haven 't been able to find him , but gustavsson is looking too
he will bring him here if that is at all possible
poor mrs holm poor mrs holm
l 'll take her back home
lt wouldn 't do for her husband to see her should he come
the evening on which these events took place was not an ordinary one
it was new year 's eve
well , we will certainly know when it 's time to toast the new year
lt 's a spooky place to await midnight , here among the dead
you gentlemen are not afraid of ghosts , i hope
then i 'd like to tell you a story while we wait for the midnight hour
l once had a pal called georges , who was generally a jolly fellow
he came of a good family , and had studied hard at uppsala university , so he knew a bit more than the rest of us
but a change would come over him on new year 's eve
remember that it 's new year 's eve , the last day of the year
whoever dies on this eve must drive the cart of death
there is an old , old cart
no ordinary driver holds the reigns
he is in the service of a strict master named death
for him , a single night is as long as 100 years on earth
night and day he must carry out his master 's business
end of part l
the phantom carriage part ll
wherever he goes , he is greeted with sorrow and despair
there is no escape he must perform his sorry duty
although the horse and cart remain the same , the driver will vary
the last soul to die each year , the one who gives up the ghost at the stroke of midnight , is destined to be death 's driver during the coming year
now you know why i 'm afraid of something fatal happening on new year 's eve
and the odd thing is , you see , that georges apparently died last new year 's eve
why hasn 't gustavsson arrived with david holm
come with me , david holm
sister edit is dying and she has asked for you
lf sister edit wants to see you , you must go at once
david , i can 't believe it 's you
you are meant to relieve me
you ought to lift me up ln your cart and take me to the hospital
no living soul rides ln this cart
by the time i arrive it is too late for a doctor
you know well enough that i am no longer alive
but , worst of all , you must face the consequences of the evil you have wrought during your lifetime
david , do you think i 'm unaware that it is my fault you have met such an end
lf you hadn 't fallen in with me you would have led a good life with your wife , children and brother
by tomorrow you will have served your time for drunken behaviour
but before you leave , a harsher punishment awaits you
behold , your brother
while you were here he killed a man while intoxicated , and now a long prison term awaits
but we feel that you ought to serve the sentence instead , since you and you alone led him astray , and made him a killer
does this not make you turn from your wicked ways , david holm
yes , for only now do i realise how it feels to have brought great misery upon a loved one
what about your wife and children
l know how miserable they felt , but i will turn over a new leaf
end of part ll
the phantom carriage part lll
no , she is not ill
she was well enough the other day , when she left
and here i was thinking i would come home to her with such joy
lf she had gone openly
i would have understood , but to slink off like that , to let me come home to an empty house , that was heartless
l 'll wipe those smiles off your faces
l 'll find her , and i 'll teach her how it feels when your heart freezes to its very core , like mine has
l 'll refrain from reminding you of your search for your wife , during which your feelings of hatred and revenge waxed stronger
l will take you to a time a year ago , to last new year 's eve , when you came here , bringing such misfortune in your wake
a salvation army station had been set up here in town
and it was ready for use on new year 's eve
keep your food ! i only want to sleep
we don 't have the sterilising oven going yet
don 't you realise , maria , how it pleases me to help the first guest god sent us
please , go to bed. lt 's been a busy day
let me attend to this
dear jesus , let our first guest be blessed with a happy year
all night long she bent over the coat , never giving thought to the germs she had inhaled
by the time she went to bed the chill of winter had thoroughly penetrated the room
did you mend my coat
would you mind fetching the person who did this
lt 's a shame you went to all that trouble , miss , but i 'm used to having it like this
before you leave , i 'd like to ask you to visit me next new year 's eve
you see , i prayed that our first guest would have a good year
and i wanted to find out if my prayers were answered
oh , i 'll be here
l 'll come to show you god didn 't give a fig for you or your twaddle
the time has come to honour that promise before you take over here
from you she contracted the disease that ends her life , and now she awaits your visit
you have possessed all that is most wonderful , but you have lost it
you cannot avoid the torment or remorse , just as you cannot escape taking over as death 's driver for a year
captive , take leave of thy prison
ye spirit that left thy body at the stroke of midnight , thou wilt relieve me of my office
for a year thou wilt reap souls
end of part lll
the phantom carriage part lv
lt is death , but too soon
you see that i 'm not afraid of you
l will gladly heed your summons , but grant me a day 's grace , for there is someone i must talk sense into
you do not know what terrible misfortune i have caused
l cannot approach the lord before i have put it right
l must tell you that the person i 'm waiting for is the man i love
do you understand ? the man i love
l would grant you grace if it would avail you , but you have no power over this man
you have tried to make him mend his ways , believing he was good , but your hopes have been dashed time and time again
you 're the one who enticed him away from his home and his work
you made him the drunkard he is
don 't let yourself be dragged under
salvation army rally
run along and be saved , and upon my soul i 'll come and watch you
what 's the use of making such a fuss
l 'm a consumptive , but i cough into people 's faces in the hope of finishing them off
why should they be better than us
he 's merely amusing himself
he 's not as wicked as he pretends to be
how can you be filled with such bitter hatred for your fellow man
you needn 't worry about that
i 'll be leaving town in a few days
no , you mustn 't do that
l would rather you stayed so i may challenge you again
however tempting that maybe , i still can 't stay
you see , little missy , i 'm on a journey throughout sweden , in search of a person i must find at all costs
who ls this person you seek
you 'll know that when i find the person in question
l am the one david holm is looking for
l am his wife
l couldn 't endure the life he led
i deserted him , took my children and crept away in secret
l moved to this town for it was so far from our old home , that i never expected him to come looking for me here
you must take him back
it 's his only hope
l didn 't mean that you must make up your mind on the spot , but promise me to listen to your heart , and we can talk again
she had got the better of herself and asked for none of the things that belonged to this world
just come with me
a surprise awaits that will make you happy

she wanted to replant the seed that had fallen among the thorns , and she may well have gained her end had it not been that
the doctor says it 's pneumonia
her resistance is so poor for she has had ill health ever since last new year 's eve
yes , this david holm has been her undoing
she worries so about the situation between him and his wife , but she mustn 't know the truth
you might at least have the heart to spare the children from infection
lt wasn 't as easy to run away this time
haven 't you had enough revenge
lf only i hadn 't brought them together again
his sin would be of less magnitude if not for me
you must grant me grace
i cannot die yet
l must see him turn over a new leaf
just spare me a few minutes
you know i love him
i 've never loved him as i do today
captive , ye of loving heart , take leave of thy prison
come along
there ls nothing for us to do here
those who are to receive her will arrive shortly
you know , david , if i could send a message to humankind
l would like to send them a new year 's greeting
l would like them to dwell on a single new year 's prayer
lord , please let my soul come to maturity before it is reaped
why are we here
surely no one here is going to die
no , i can 't go on. i can 't go on
l 'm sorry , but i must go away , and i cannot leave them behind
please don 't be angry with me
it 's not my fault
this will do , david
it will suffice for the children and myself
yes , david , i see what 's coming
l 'm obliged to watch
i do not shirk my duty
you mustn 't let it happen
thls mustn 't come to pass
don 't let those poor , innocent creatures die
l have no power over the living
where shall i turn
should i pray to god or to jesus
who can tell me where to direct my plea
l 'm a poor , miserable sinner , i beseech thee lord of life and death
l 'm not worthy , i 've broken your every commandment
sentence me to eternal night
let nothing remain of me
do what you like to me , my lord , only spare the three of them
david , i see that i no longer need to grieve for you
she hasn 't done it yet
i made it here in time
sister edit is dead , and i have been at her side
l promised her to become a good husband and father
you 're lying
sister maria told me you refused to go to her
are you crying , david
no one believes i want to reform
l want to be good , but no one believes me. ls it any wonder i cry
lt 's hard to believe , david
but i do believe you
your tears convinced me
l can 't help crying too
l won 't be truly happy until my sorrow is drained

first verse
lost in a valley , as if in a dream , there lay a little town to which two youths , drunk with love and filled with life , were drawn
but as the golden leaves fell from the trees like tears thickly in sunset 's glow , there at the crossroads , where so much had passed , stood death , awaiting them in silence
a town lost to memory
every evening , the local dignitaries gathered at the "; golden unicorn "; inn for their nightcap
his importance , the mayor
his reverence , the vicar
his learnedness , the physician
his measuredness , the notary
and the new schoolmaster
every evening , the wise , antique figurine of the lamp would hear the news of important goings-on in town
but lately the honorable dignitaries had but one topic of conversation
the stranger
again and again , nothing but the stranger
one day the gravedigger was approached by a stranger , who asked the way to town
he seemed strangely familiar to him although he had never come face-to-face with him before
who owns the land adjoining the graveyard
the town magistrate has reserved it for the cemetery extension
i think it unlikely that the magistrate would be willing to let you have the future cemetery land
why the devil are you so set on having it
i am a wanderer who is very weary. i wish to plant a garden there
next to the cemetery
in the council meeting , there was heated debate over the stranger 's request , but the gold the stranger offered proved too tempting
the stranger 's offer was unanimously accepted and the cemetery annex was leased to him for 99 years
but joy at the town 's bulging coffers did not remain unclouded , for the stranger erected a wall around his land as invincible as the barrier his ways had created between himself and others
see for yourselves , gentlemen
i have walked all around the wall but found neither door nor gate
men , your efforts are in vain
only i know the gate that opens this wall
and to this day no one has found a door in the eerie wall
it is a time-honored tradition that young couples take their first drink at the "; unicorn
from our bridal cup. one can see right on your faces that you are sweethearts
excuse me , could you tell me where my fiancé has gone
my dear child , your fiancé left with the stranger who was sitting at your table
second verse
she seeks her love both here and there and wanders every alley
she has strayed beyond the town
there in the moonlight , grave-by-grave , lies the old cemetery wall
a cold stream of pale figures flows around her
the bell tolls , the watchman cries
love wrestles with death and believes
hear my words , my good townsfolk
the clock has just struck ten
take care lest too much wine you drink , and end in the devil 's realm
there are herbs that draw mysterious powers from the magical light of the full moon
david 's harp and solomon 's seal , boxthorn and centaury
no one knew this better than the old apothecary
the old pharmacy has watched its owner since childhood days when he stuck his nose into his father 's retorts and melting pots
but today , for the first time ever , it found him together with a young girl
poor child , you 're trembling with fever
just wait , i 'll brew you a strong tea. that will make you feel better
the song of solomon
set me as a seal upon thine heart , as a seal upon thine arm
for love is strong as death , passion is cruel as the grave
it blazes up like blazing fire , fiercer than any flame
for love is as strong as death
hear my words , my good townsfolk
the clock has struck eleven
what , my child , do you seek in my realm
i did not summon you
i want to go where my beloved is
where is he whom you stole from me
i did not steal him
his time was merely up
what you see here are the lives of men , they flare up and burn for a time
but then they are extinguished at the hour the lord decides
believe me , my task is heavy
it is a curse
i am weary of witnessing the suffering of men and earning their hatred for obeying the lord
o death , is there no way to awaken to new life a light that 's been extinguished
is there no way to overcome you
i do believe : love is stronger than death
is your love stronger than death
do you wish to fight he who is eternal
i would bless you if you should conquer me
see here three lights about to flicker out
i place it in your hands to spare them
if you should succeed , even though it be just one , i will grant to you your beloved 's life

tomorrow is my birthday and i have commanded that there shall be great joy throughout the middle kingdom

son of heaven , forgive the dirty toad that kisses the dust at your feet

dear mr. a hi , i am very pleased with you
i shall keep the horse and the girl as well
o most venerable one , that is impossible
i cannot do without the girl when working magic

you cannot ? let me show you how well you can ! either

may he gather you both to him for your passion and suffering
do you understand now , my child , why i grow so tired and weary of my task
i am the eternally invincible
go back among the living , and live
grant me the life of my beloved
there is one final way
within the span of one earthly hour bring me another life , one that has not yet expired , one for whom years , days and hours lie ahead
then i will return to you the life of your beloved
the clock has struck eleven
take care with fire and the light so that none shall come to harm
praise the lord
death has taken my beloved from me
i wanted to follow him
old man , you have enjoyed life so long
what more can it offer you
give me your life
grant me the last few days you are still allotted
help me to save the life of my beloved
not a single day , not a single hour , not a single breath
the beggar
beggar , do you seek an end to all of your suffering

not a single day , not a single hour , not a single breath
the infirmary
the woman in childbed is well and the child is healthy
but the young lad who was brought in this evening died shortly before ten
oh , my lord , the poor boy ! so young , yet he had to die
for the likes of us , we 'd be glad no longer to wake up in early morning. death seems to have passed over us
if you have grown so weary of your life , which of you will give me yours for compassion 's sake
that was the last one
my child
another life , one that has not yet expired
i was not able to overcome you for that price
now take my life as well ! for without my beloved it is less than nothing to me
i shall take you to the man you love
he who gives up his life shall gain it
hear my words , my good townsfolk
the clock has just struck twelve
take care against ghosts and apparitions ! let no foul spirit enchant your soul

on a warm winter afternoon , the sun was rising
through the clouds , it was throwing its light on this ravine
taro is a small woodcutter favorite of his master
hey
go for taro
hey taro , your master is calling you
take this package to the station , before the next train out
then you can go home
in a city street , there were people around the yagibushi dancers
taro passed by and joined them
obstitane butler
i 'll shoot him with the airgun
miss
miss
the girl , opened a way through the crowd to the yagibushi dancers
the girl doesn 't have any money
taro sympathizes and offers all his coins
here you are , miss
let 's go home together
mitsuko , ex-girlfriend of koichiro , niece of the master
without money or food , and tired from the long trip to the rocks of the ravine
kojiro sugino , who was expelled from the orchestra in the capital , had a rugged life , but now has changed
he is returning home to his father , where he lived years ago
koichiro sugino fainted while playing at the musical society
if you don 't come home and apologise now , i will no longer regard you as my son
koichiro sugino , panned by the public
yoko , a former famous singer married to koichiro , is the only one who supports him
fumiko , koichiro daughter
yoko , fumiko , forgive and be patient
when we get home everything will be easier
tsurukichi is a pitiful tramp a recently freed convict , who has nothing , but his feeling to be cast out of society , his poverty and hunger
kamezo , is a pitiful tramp a recently freed convict , who has nothing , but his feeling to be cast out of society , his poverty and hunger
and also has tuberculosis
the night keeps the sadness and breaks the joy , as christmas arrives
kamezo and tsurukichi had to start walking after finishing their daily breakfast
today as ususal , the master has gone to work in the mountains
in the villa they are installing christmas ornaments
see the yagibishi dancers over there , ask them if they can come to our house tonight
can you perform at our house tonight
- yes , with pleasure
what
i said give us something
we have nothing
we have not eaten for days
the girl is crying a lot
they look really bad
i propose to share our bread
crossroads of destiny. two go to the right , three to the left
i helped this little hare , wounded by a gunshot
unfortunately , it is not old enough to live without its parents
hey taro
go home and look after the hare
finally they reach the mountain ridge , from where he can see his hometown
this will be the last trip
ah ... all what i see here is my home
what you see is my home
these wood , forest and mountains are our blessing
cheer up
i 'm sure my father can accomodate us
i 'll take this to my grandfather
dusk , when the wind blows in the treetops
the master comes back home after finishing his day 's work
koichiro has reached the door of his house thanks to the encouragement of his wife and daughter
do you work at this house
can you tell me
is my father in
the master
he will be back soon
mitsuko also
mitsuko 's home
i 'll call her
mitsuko combing alone
ma 'am , please come
someone 's asking for you
i 'm combing now
wait for a while
they reached a secluded villa
because they 're so hungry and tired
the need does not respect any laws
a little christmas tree
i cannot cut it without tools
i 'll borrow some from the butler
the old guard is wiping out the sweat , of a working day in the mountains
hey , if they find us , we will have to go to that dark place again
why this look
are you going to drink , too
no , thanks
i will drink with my father
seems that your daughter has a fever
what do you mean
i do not see anyone
who 's there
who 's there
feed the dogs
and if the storm comes , take them in
father i am koichiro
taro , anything can happen today , the others and you should stay home
your hands are shaking
i 'll turn on the light
no , i have not received help for 10 years
i 'll do it alone , without your help
bring me some wood
if you do not stop , i 'll shoot
i ask a favor
i want to be reborn
give joy to this family
father , our bodies have the same blood
do not you hear the sound of our blood
where was that blood for so long
exchange
now you shall strike
father , then , do you agree to let us stay tonight
father , i ask you a favor
a man with his wife and daughter , with no place to sleep
and nothing to eat
we are begging you
my head is going to explode
you said you 'd take the dogs inside
my dogs are important
you 're not
you 're late
you 're late
what is special about today
koichiro , i think you will like this
you idiot
take away the extra plates , two plates is enough
the guard is becoming merciful
this is an important moment
hear
the first verse is for you
embrace her , please , father
well , you see
we will leave soon
i do not own anything
all that i have , are my wife and daughter
mitsuko , bring me a glass of that wine
no , i can not
i will prepare the beds
well , find sugino and ask him to bring taro to the christmas party
i would go , but i can not leave here tonight
thank you for coming
since i can not go , please take them with you instead
happiness
a terrible snow storm , strikes with demonic rage
finally the father refuses to accomodate them
they go out in the snowstorm , hungrier and more tired than when they arrived
we can sleep here
what is this sorry state
where you did you leave your art. try to play it
idiot
the master was anxious and went to look for a woodcutter
the young girl was missing taro
you can come home
i will remain with you , even if i have to leave my daughter here on the floor
if i leave , i have no another door open to me
- and if you go through that the door i would close shortly thereafter
do not say anything more
what would you do if i was a thief
it is impossible to forgive you
no father
please let me stay at home
say yes , please
stand up
otherwise i will throw the dog at you
what do you say
throw the dog at me
leaving aside other things , a man of honor would not fight with someone like you
mitsuko has decided
go away with this
taro is worried and follows them secretely
i have prepared a room
okay
take the woman and the girl and ask the maids for help
ah , the sweet sound of old violin
please go away
the daughter
the daughter is already cold
a new life
if my servant had not been kind to them
if the master had taken pity on him
we have to be merciful with the whole mankind
for example , jesus was merciful and told us to do the same

castle vogelöd
the revelation of a secret 5 acts based on the story of the same name in the berliner illustrirte zeitung by rudolf stratz
adapted by carl mayer
direction
f. w. murnau
1st act
for days now , a rained-out october hunt at castle vogelöd
the lord of the castle
the guests
count oetsch
you
count oetsch ?
you forgot to invite me ?
the retired provincial judge
he 's reputed to have shot his brother dead three years ago
he thereby became sole heir
the anxious gentleman
every single person who was able to follow the proceedings at the time is convinced he 's the murderer
once more i stress i 'm still expecting your brother 's widow as a guest this evening
the murder victim 's widow
she got married again one year ago to baron safferstätt
i should like to spare us all the experience of the baroness encountering you here , count
so you 're staying
then let it be on your head
awaiting the baroness
any moment now she 'll be showing up and inside is count oetsch
so you claim to have learnt the art of prophecy in india
would you care to reveal then , in light of this rain-drenched hunt , whether any of us will be able to get off a shot
one shot will be fired
... oetsch is inside ! ... perhaps even ... two ?
you 'll understand that ... under these circumstances ... we cannot stay ... at your side
no ! you can 't just leave
do you know who 's coming here to see you
father faramund from rome
father ... faramund ... from rome
yes
in all the excitement i had almost forgotten
i have to go and get his letter for you this instant
father
faramund ... ?
surely you don 't mean to throw me out of your house
she 's staying
she wants to wait for father faramund
that the wife of my so tragically deceased relative will be your guest fills me with great joy
i bless the circumstance that leads me north again after my decades-long sojourn in rome
in the days ahead i will come to vogelöd to finally see all of you , my dear friends , face to face
end of the first act
2nd act
the next day - a surprise : sunshine
well , finally
weather forecast : sunny today
no precipitation
aren 't you coming along on the hunt
i only hunt in rain and gale
say , why is it your husband 's always so quiet
but , of course , after about a quarter of an hour
daytime
his reverence , father faramund has just reported he 'll be arriving this evening
that bizarre oetsch is really going hunting in such beastly weather
of course he would know to stay out of the way of his kin , the father
i will ... have much ... to discuss ... with the father ... this evening
evening
if the baroness wishes , i will be happy to see her this evening
now our house is blessed
no matter what happens , think ... kindly of me
the baroness bids his reverence enter
speak ... dear child ... speak
how strange .. reverend ... this encounter
because all these years
i 've wrestled with my thoughts
with you , reverend .. as the only person , friend and kin to my deceased husband , that i can talk to
it 's now been 4 years
end of the second act
3rd act
our marriage was ... at first ... like one continuous day of bliss
and so we spent months in inebriated bliss
one day he went off
weeks later he came back ... he was a different person
buried himself in writings ... holy books
believe me , dear child , true happiness lies only in the renunciation of all worldly things
he turned into a saint ... he only wanted to see a saint in me
and for months it was like that
i grew cold ... the more pure he became , the more terrible i found my earthly bonds
i thirsted ... to see evil ... to desire evil
then i came to know baron safferstätt
my husband wanted to give away his possessions , to divide up his fortune amongst the poor ... terrible arguments erupted between him and his brother ... one evening - there was an all-out row
something horrible happened - my husband ... was ... shot
i can 't go on any further
not right now
tomorrow
if you 'll excuse me for the rest of the day
i 'll call upon the master of the manor tomorrow
tall tales of the hunt
so you don 't believe i got a lion once
night-time
ask the reverend to see me
quarter of an hour later
no ! no-one left through here
we 've looked around the entire castle
it 's getting downright eerie in here
one hour later
no trace of the father can be found
a crime ?
maybe it was ... count oetsch
dreams
that does it
tomorrow i 'm getting out of here
but meanwhile , the kitchen boy is also dreaming of the events of the last few hours
end of the third act
4th act
the morning of the third day
surely you understand
out of nowhere important business to attend to
is there anyone left who isn 't frightened by my house
i 've notified the authorities
regarding my suspicion of this count oetsch
one happy man
she 's so strange
says nothing .. nothing at all
about the father going missing ... ?
midday
you once committed a murder ?
what ... are you ... trying to
say by that
gentlemen
why don 't you just let me finish ?
that is what i dreamt this past night
count oetsch
it seems to me that the mood in my house at this moment is not suited to such jokes
believe you me , my eye for spotting criminals is adept
and i 'm saying count oetsch is definitely connected to the disappearance of the father
he 's putting on airs in order to conceal his latest crime
he needs to apologise to you in front of all the guests for his inappropriate jokes
you absolutely need to speak with him
so you know something , count
perhaps you have some idea of who people here suspect in the disappearance of the father
me
but i know even more , herr retired provincial judge
i can also glean secrets
for example , i 'd now like to reveal to our baron one of his secrets
count oetsch
if you know other peoples ' secrets , you should not reveal them in front of everybody
i shall honour your opinion
i 'd like to whisper only a very few words to baron safferstätt
no
i .. am .. no ... murderer
just what are these accusations
is it perhaps that you wish to accuse the baron in the murder of your brother
perhaps
i will consult baron safferstätt
today i 'll reveal it
he is the murderer of my husband
in an argument , he shot his brother
end of the fourth act
5th act
half an hour later
what do you know about that time
dear ... speak !
the count certainly made haste
and i tell you , he 's also got the father on his conscience
father faramund ... has returned
yesterday i wanted solace
you didn 't come ! ... today
because you , as a priest , are obliged to remain silent
we can do nothing right now
the events of recent days probably will now become clear
a few days before the murder of my husband oh , i dread so much holiness
a ... murder !
baron safferstätt , consumed by passion for me , had misunderstood me in a gruesome way !
he shot my husband
two days later he confessed to me
then i recognised my guilt as well
the count was arrested
had he been convicted we would have poisoned ourselves
in order to prove his innocence
but ! he was not convicted
we carried on
fearing life
fearing death
each of us cursed
bound through our guilt
we got married
that was our marriage
so we were two comrades
and today i have redeemed him
i have accused count oetsch of fratricide
that is how far fate has driven me
now you know everything ! and you must remain silent
i ... understand ... you !
act like a man
i ... was ... not ... happy
a ... shot ?
evening calm
he ... is ... dead !
i , the innocent outcast , always knew
so every circumstance had to be aligned just so , in order for me to be finally set free from this degrading suspicion
for that reason i forestalled the arrival of father faramund at the castle
we have much to apologise to you for
evening
i am father faramund from rome

werner krafft
hmm
do you know a william krafft
william krafft is my brother
he used to live in the city hotel
i haven 't seen him in five years
i had to leave europe , while
i 'll be very happy to help william krafft 's brother
the jewellery dealers
for florence
you know what , krafft ? your brother werner was here
i have lent him money , william , because ... because i thought
tonight i need to get a ring , that looks just like this one
that was krafft
to the city hotel
mr. yquem has had to close the office a little earlier today , madam
no , madame , his lordship is not back yet
she is called miss florence forster. she disappeared four years ago
her current whereabouts are not known
the city hotel
florence yquem
- tiergartenstr . 245 my love ; unfortunately i have to take a business trip , but i shall return tomorrow
kisses from your , harry
it 's sad that the days pass so quickly , that i have to spend them away from you
margot , a friend of florence
tonight i would like "; dinner for two
turtle soup
fried oysters
pâté de fois gras en croûte
with white port wine vintage 1864 , roast beef with artichoke hearts , mushrooms , rémoulade sauce
plus , a very fiery chambertin 1911 ... i do not want any dessert , but cheese ... baked
florence yquem
- tiergartenstr . 245 my love ; unfortunately i have to take a business trip , but i shall return tomorrow
kisses from your , harry
mr. krafft has just gone out
anyway , i need a room
as you have no luggage , you will have to pay for the room in advance
this will take you to old upton
in the meantime , you can wait here for mr. krafft
you look great , my child
but why do all this if your husband is always travelling
well , a beautiful woman , need not necessarily be true to her husband
mr krafft left the hotel about an hour ago , but he has ordered dinner for two at 10pm
i love my husband more than anything , margot
but before you got married , were you not in love with another man
i remember there was much talk about it , but nobody knew exactly who he was
back then i loved my husband , but not as i love him today
my heart belonged to another man
and when my father gave me away to harry against my will
i must speak to miss florence again , at any cost
it 's useless to tell you the name of my future husband
it would be pointless to go against the will of my father
let 's go up and see if florence has recovered from her migraine
she is not alone
and then ? and then
you have made me very curious about your story and i can 't wait to hear how it continues
is mr. yquem at home
then you better tell his wife
this is very interesting , really interesting
and your husband never found out what was going on
charles meunier - requests to be invited in for the lady 's own good
i don 't understand you , florence
why do you dismiss these visitors
just yesterday i met a gentleman at the city hotel , and already today
my dear lady : would you do me the honour of dining with me today in the same restaurant for dinner , where we met yesterday
i kiss the tips of your rosy fingers
and your husband , margot
my husband
my husband takes care of his business ... like yours
what 's wrong with you
you look like a hunter , laying in wait
you 're right , and there is the target , that i 'm waiting for
i 'll tell you , on the evening of my betrothal to florence , something mysterious occurred
florence retired to her bedroom as she was suffering migraines ; her father and i were worried about her condition , so we went up to her room
tell me the truth , florence
do you love this man
i can 't believe that florence has deceived me
although i can 't get the memory of that evening out of my mind
go to tiergartenstr . 245 , the yquem residence
you 'll only get it back when you use your own lips
in the bible it is written : "; let not thy left hand know what thy right is doing
i must discover the truth , whatever the cost
let us not question your confidence in me , my beloved harry , my heart and soul belong only to you
i have never yearned for another , and i remain for now and forever- your florence
i must be certain
bring me an envelope without letterhead
i only have a penny and i beg you once again to give me a little ammount of money
i don 't know what else to do
please allow me a little longer as i 'm waiting here for my brother
i have just learned that you are back in town , and i beg you , i hope to see you this evening
always yours , florence
you can count on it , he will suffer for this , the scoundrel
i have just learned that you are back in town , and i beg you , i hope to see you this evening
always yours , florence
i need a taxi in five minutes
i am glad to see , my dear , that you have been enjoying yourself without me
i will therefore no longer stand in the way of your pleasure
how long is it from here to tiergartenstr . 245
you are making a big mistake , mr. yquem , if you continue to neglect your wife
consul , your master is not coming
we must be alone again
for once and for all , the lady is not interested in seeing you
that should be enough to change her mind
charles meunier - if you continue to refuse to see me , then tomorrow the whole city will know about that mysterious incident on the day of your betrothal to your husband
show him in
do what you will. destiny is in your hands
you can reveal whatever you want to the world , but you will never persuade me to break the oath that i swore to my husband
werner
please forgive me , but you look incredibly like an old friend
so this letter then was also meant for my brother , werner
that is indeed my handwriting , but i never wrote such a letter
do you know anything about what happened to your brother
please , my lady , spare me the questions about my brother
he will be lounging around somewhere in some far off country
dear william , i have returned , but misfortune has followed me
the woman , who is the reason for my return , i am unable to find. the bearer of this letter , i owe money
please help me , otherwise you condemn me to a sad end
i know where yquem lives
he has a very beautiful wife
a mr. krafft is with the lady
prepare madame 's baggage
she will leave the house this very night
you 've made a mistake , mr. yquem
locked
my poor friend
i knew all about this and have come ... to help you in your hour of need
women are all the same
forget them
no , i will never forget florence
i have come , my lord , to warn you
your wife is in great danger
florence ?
florence ?
florence is here
your wife doesn 't want to make up with you , because you have offended her honour
she will leave this house under my protection
charles meunier - if you continue to refuse to see me , then tomorrow the whole city will know about that mysterious incident on the day of your betrothal to your husband
in fact , mr. superintendent
as soon as i realized that my ring was swapped , i rushed here to report it. but
mr. krafft recently left in a car to tiergartenstr . 245
no officials in uniform
all in civilian clothes
that 's my brother. but he never told me anything about all this
forgive me , florence
all of my life and work will be devoted to you
my thoughts are only of you
florence , i know that i am not worthy of you , to ask such a question , but please show me pity
what happened on the day of our betrothal
i don 't want the shadow of suspicion to be on you
i 'll take all the blame
where do you think you 're going , my boy
don 't you want to say "; good evening "; to an old friend like me
we caught the thief
but who killed the man whose body lies on the floor
he 's innocent
he killed him to protect my honour
this ruby is part of the gem collection that has been stolen from the duke of axminster
how did it come to be in your possession
what day was the theft committed
if so , then i can prove my husband 's innocence
i can provide him with an alibi , with the help of my diary. i keep it in the winter garden
werner

i feel all the weight of my guilt
if you left me , i would deserve it
harry

jurko jánošík did not know what was going on at home when he was coming back to see his old parents after two years of studies and distress
little bread , much work
god bless you
i am exhausted after the long journey
could i have some water
enjoy it. to your health
oh , this is our neighbour anka. yes , anka
pišta
it happened two years ago
easy , easy. the kiss is hot you could burn your moustache

through the scarf only
well-known cottages
jánošík 's friend and protector
i have not seen my father and mother yet
how are they
are they healthy
dear father
where is mom
mom , my dear mom
the old jánošík was not at work again
my wife died
she would not have jumped out of the coffin even if you came to work
fifty strokes with a stick
go and tell jánošík they are beating his father
how can you ? you , you
it is good the monk is here , we can save on the funeral
and he was beaten so badly that he died on the same day
at the village
to work
to work
think it over and you will never have to work for your lords
they chase him , so jánošík hides in a cave
oh , mother , mother dear , a long way from here. i cry longing for you want to be near
bless you
thank you , anka
do not leave
i thought there was nobody to look after my parents ' graves. but you
annie , you are an angel
no , annie , i shall not become a priest
the bloody nobs make it impossible
you cannot run away this time
we shall catch him and earn a hundred ducats as a reward
an uninvited witness
well , you can fight pretty well , father
i am not a priest yet and probably shall never be one
this dog and šándor took me everything and chased me like an animal
is it you , jánošík from terchová
is it really you
welcome
i am hrajnoha , the bandits ' captain
we nearly forgot about that one
pay a fine
hey , there 's a grove up the way. there 's a path up the way. my father was a good fellow
fellows ! here - jánošík - our new companion - let him be our captain
long live jánošík
long live our new captain
dear friends
i should have been a priest but satan crossed my plans
do you want me to be your captain
well then , i accept
i promise to be your fair leader
as so far , we shall go on protecting the serfs
we will help them in all possible ways
our will - our strength
let the serfs benefit from all our doings
the lords take us everything - our properties , freedom , lives - we shall not spare them ! but remember , we shall not kill anybody
death shall not change anybody
long live jánošík
long live our captain
the walls in the count šándor 's mansion were the silent witnesses of the gentry 's wild life
not every squire is a good squire. the hungarian squire is the best
in the neighbouring domain. visitors are coming
his nobility - baron révay
oh , what a pleasant surprise
well , your nobility , will you pay your debt at last
of course i will
yes , i was just checking how much i got
how many times shall i mention my 5.ooo guldens
i will put you up for public auction
is it still the old wine
lo ! what wine
well , will you sell me a bushel
to sell
it will be a present from me , sir
oh no , it would be much waste , i shall buy it
believe me , sir , upon my squire word , if the crop was in the barns i would pay you immediately. but where to get money now
and what about the peasants ? could they not pay your debt
what do you mean
well , it is simple
each peasant will pay 5o pennies
those who do not have the money will pay in produce
the jew will buy them and you will get money
well , sir , tell my servant not to get the horses until tomorrow
hereby we announce that our venerable lord and owner count šándor orders his serfs to pay 5o pennies. those who have no money , will pay the tax in goods
those who refuse will be beaten and put in the stocks
give me back my pots
i have nothing to pay the tax with. i could not pay you for your work
well , i shall mend them gratis
after a short while
really cheap
did he pay
i am coming to collect the tax in the afternoon
it was very good advice , indeed
we are even now
you can use my advice also next time
fellows , i must go down to the village
and you , hrajnoha , take care of baron révay
the serf cannot rest even on sunday
when will a squire keep his word
the daughter is alone , isn 't she
you will not work hard in this cabin any more , you will come with me to my manor-house
you must be sensible , you will be well in the manor-house
oh , you are like a scared little animal. do not be so stubborn
you will soon forget about that bandit
here he is , the bandit
well , so this is the bandit nest , isn 't it ? but you shall not escape this time
you coward
well , you will pay for those words
at the father 's protection
father , help me. rescue annie from šándor
dear son , what path did you take
oh , father , do not condemn me. you know the soul of the suffering serfs
oh , mercy
be a father to my anka
jánošík took care of the poor serfs , helped them together with the local priest and other secret friends
evening at the parish house
what šándor 's people took , cannot be given back
here , jánošík is sending you some ducats for the damage
meeting at the county administrator 's place
is the hungarian squire not the master and lord of his peasants any more
should we let these dirty bandits order us what to do and want not to do
well , do you know what happened at the last county ball
before midnight ... when everybody was having a good time
you rob from the serfs , i rob from you
and each of your sins will be punished
you let my father be beaten to death
you took everything from me
remember , you shall not escape my revenge
and we should take this
this is not a good order
gentlemen , i promise you to clear your county of this group of bandits
here , commissioner will give you soldiers
the trap is ready
is his lover hiding at the parish
where has the bandit 's lover gone
and you , foolish old man , give the bandits ' money to peasants
your master will throw you out of the parish
i have resigned myself to anything
well , old man , is there some wine for your guest
hey , old woman ! has some bandit fallen in love with you yet
what brought you here ? what can i do for you
i came to confess
but this time you will confess to me
does the bandit come here often
he does not
why do you not bring the girl here
what for
what for
so she can tell me where the bandit is
i do not know
you know where he is , too
tell me , you old fool
don 't you know it
jánošík
for goodness sake , save yourself ! soldiers
go away ! away
come on , mišo ! come on
let the house shake
while at the farm
look out , fellows
prepare your pistols , get ready and follow me
no , jánošík ! we must not lose you
i am the first to go
in the name of his majesty , surrender , jánošík
eternal peace
the verdict. as the accused and his , already punished , companions , are found guilty , having been accused of many felonies : arson , robbery and even murder , he is sentenced to death
so as to warn others , the punishment differs from others and jánošík is sentenced to be hung by his left rib on a hook and quartered after his death ! let the sentence be carried out without delay
such was the death of jánošík , the first fighter for freedom of the slovak people
thank you , shepherd
take care

a drama of people of our time
prelude
dr. mabuse , the great gambler ... playing with people ... and their destinies has ordered an attack through to be committed through ... the dancer ... cara carozza ... against his pursuer ... , state attorney von wenk , young hull was her victim
countess told , whom he loves
dear mr. von wenk
i am not suitable to be your ally
please forgive me if for that reason i have to disappoint you
the sleeping woman -- --
i am not suitable to be your ally
yours , dusy told , countess
only now shall the world learn who i am
i ! mabuse ! a giant -- a titan who jumbles up laws and gods ... like withered leaves
count told , would you not like to confide what happened to you
i have cheated in the game
i cheated-- ! yes--
i who usually never touch a card - - i had such a streak of luck
frankly , it scared me
were all your guests old acquaintances
all , except one ... whom my wife had invited the psychoanalyst dr. mabuse
but he did not join in the game
my wife has left me ... surely she has gone home to her mother ... because she does not want to share her life with a card-cheat --
don 't you trust any doctor at all
some experienced psychiatrist in whom you could confide
dr. mabuse
count told is on the phone
doctor , you were present ... when i had that-- accident at the card table
i need your medical help
i treat patients only in their homes
end of act i
ready
they will move her to the women 's prison
the eleventh hour -
your case interests me -
- i will treat you
for as long as you are under my treatment you will not leave the house , not receive anybody , not speak to anybody
you must not see anyone who reminds you of your former life
as from today i am not available to anyone , neither personally nor by telephone
tell everybody asking for me or the countess that we have gone away for an indefinite time
please connect me to count told
the countess is not staying with her mother
i am sorry , but sir and madam are away
i am sorry , mr. state attorney , but sir and madam left this morning
my brother has sent a colleague with the message that la carozza has been taken to the women 's prison
the blind -- --
if by some damned coincidence they got on my track
i 'll get away through this tunnel
from underneath a gentle push will lift the door
put on something decent and report to me
captivity
my sudden disappearance will not go unnoticed
unless the state attorney really hurries up , he won 't have much more time to free you
and your husband ...
your husband is under my medical treatment
you 'd better not speak of your husband
do not dare even to think of him ! you will be pronouncing his death sentence if you mention his name in my presence
good god , hurry up
for a while i 'd be ... in a jail ... for women
your situation is only your fault , miss carozza
why are you so obstinate , miss carozza ? if you 'd assist us in clearing up hull 's murder
you are sacrificing yourself for a scoundrel who has simply abandoned you -- and in vain -- for we are already on his tail
he is stronger than all of you
he destroys anybody he wants too
i am supposed to check the electrical wiring in here
the man for whose sake you are here has thrown you away like a squeezed fruit
like a squeezed fruit strip
he knows very well that it might cost you your head - and he does not lift a finger to help you-- -- and who can guarantee that no other woman has long since replaced you in his heart
give me two days time
i have to go get a ladder
when will wenk be back
wenk has managed to wear down la carozza
then we must liquidate
that will cost you your life , my boy
but ... why
i 'll try an experiment
i will confront him with la carozza. perhaps one of them will give themselves away -- or both ...
end of act ii
act iii
who
no , no , no ... i will not say anything ... or the same thing will happen to me
take this man to police headquarters under double guard and with every conceivable precaution
you should go down a road different from usual
and if i have to cross-examine you for 48 hours
they arrested johannes gutter
they 're taking him to police headquarters
all his life johannes gutter has devoted himself to our just cause
that 's why he has been taken from our midst now
are we going to put up with that ?
we will not let him down
we will free him
they are not taking the usual route
they are going through mueller street
johannes gutter
johannes gutter
release johannes gutter
be sensible , folks
the prisoner we 're transporting. is not johannes gutter at all
see for yourselves that the prisoner is not gutter
but then be sensible and clear the path
where have the people with the prisoner got to
after the incident with la carozza , i will not have a minute of peace ... i won 't rest until i know that fellow to be in your special care
carozza was thoroughly searched when she was brought in
how did she suddenly get the poison
even in the women 's prison , the great unknown must have his accomplices
in mueller street we suddenly could not get any further
god knows who incited those people--
wake up to the countess ... and tell her that i wish to speak to her
i 've never seen that person before
none of us knew him
but since he shot his mouth off -- --
you wished to speak to me
the game between us must end -- one way -- or the other
i am no longer the man i used to be
i make mistakes
losing my nerve
i intend to leave this city , this country , countess and i have come to ask if you want to join me
i want you to be mine
for the last time , countess , will you follow me of your free will -- or as a prisoner
never ! do you hear me ?
never
i want to return to my husband
you have now pronounced pronounced his death sentence--
nocturnal phantoms --
the day
dr. mabuse
your condition has deteriorated
-- you are sicker than ever
do you know that your wife wants to commit you to an insane asylum
your wife has left you --
your life is ruined -- you cannot go on living -- -
- - not go on living --
the count must be left absolutely alone - any disturbance could be fatal
not go on living
with the razor -- --
end act iii
act iv
where is the countess
i have not seen her ... since that terrible night at the card game
hen why did you tell me on the telephone that the master and mistress had gone away
i was ordered to do so by the count
in my humble opinion , sir , the master grew really bad only after
dr. mabuse treated him
since we are going abroad tomorrow , countess here are the people who will have the honor to be at your service
i want to return to my husband
your husband is dead ...
if there is any human feeling in you --
if there is any human feeling in you --
let me go to my husband
i 'm going to personally visit dr. mabuse
do you know the address
dr. mabuse , psychoanalysis
i am very sorry , the doctor is out
no news , mr. prosecutor
with your permission
dr. mabuse
what a strange coincidence , doctor ! i have just come from your house
now come from home
i wanted to inform you of the suicide of your patients , count told
and i , state attorney von wenk , came to ask your help in preventing just such a tragedy
the case of count told is so unusual from beginning to end that i have become convinced that both as card-cheat and as suicide , the count acted under the compulsion of some overpowering , but to him , hostile mind
are you familiar with weltmann 's experiments
today ! today ! an evening of experiments sandor weltmann
hypnosis , trance , natural magnetism , the secrets
of the indian fakirs. the secrets of the psyche
the subconscious in man and animal
in the main auditorium of philharmonic hall at 8 o 'clock
you would there see with your own eyes how weltmann due to his tremendous suggestive powers , is able to compel people to act in a way diametrically opposite to their nature ...
--preferably , people who try to resist his influence--
and you believe count told fell victim to such an overpowering influence of some unknown enemy
you have roused my curiosity , doctor i will follow your suggestion
forgive me just one more question , doctor
do you happen to know the whereabouts of countess told
how come you let that gentleman into my office without informing me
are not even you to be relied on any more
as soon as you see wenk approaching , start the engine and let him pass
then you come back here as quickly as possible
this time his whole bodyguard won 't save the state attorney
i don 't know if sandor weltmann himself is the puppeteer
in any case , we are dealing with an opponent where the improbable is the most likely of all things expected
that means you 'll just have to act on your own initiative--

today ! an evening of experiments sandor weltmann

in the main auditorium of philharmonic hall 8 o 'clock
ladies and gentlemen
i would next like to demonstrate to you a case of typical mass suggestion such as is the power base of the hindu fakirs
would somebody please call out a couple of two-digit numbers
seat number 12 is empty
perhaps the gentleman at number 11 would be so kind--
in the right inside pocket of your jacket you have two 1000 - mark notes issued in 1918 , series d and series no . 65045 no
f 5567 , a weapon license , one identity card ; in your left inside pocket you carry a browning -- is that correct
would you please read out what it says on the note
the lady from number 64 shall remove the browning from the inside pocket of the gentleman at number 11 and give it to the gentleman at number 5
would the gentleman at number 11 be so kind as to be available for one more experiment
then i would ask you , as well as a few other ladies and gentleman
to come up and join me on the stage
a new experiment ! this gentleman will be so kind and carry out what i have written down in this sealed envelope
-nan -fu
tsi-nan-fu
dr. ma
do what i have written down
you conduct the lady to her seat , leave the auditorium , get into the car number 3825 waiting outside the door , and drive at full speed over the mountain road into the quarry. melior
the note says
you lead the lady to her seat , leave the auditorium , go home and go to bed
this thing gives me an eerie feeling
boss , the "; great unknown "; we are looking for
dr. mabuse , doctor , gambler , criminal--
to the closest police station
and as fast as possible
finale
i 'll look after the car , you wake fine and the countess
let the doctor sleep as long as possible. after last night 's business , he was completely exhausted
we can 't get out , the police have surrounded the house
end of act v
act vi
they are resisting more stubbornly than we anticipated
the men should keep under cover ... until i give further instructions
a telephone conversation --
this is state attorney von wenk speaking
doctor mabuse , i request you not to resist the forces of justice
i don 't know anything about your ' justice
if you want me -- get me
we are determined to proceed against you with the fiercest means
give up your pointless resistance
i allow myself to draw your attention to the fact that countess told is also in the house
we must get the army to help us
dr. mabuse has a prisoner ... told ... the countess
we have to storm the house quickly , otherwise the lady 's life will be in danger
doctor
the army is coming--
and you snort coke , you chicken
let the woman go , doctor
save yourself
where is mabuse
shut up , spoerri
remember pesch
--home--
caught--
will he keep his mouth shut , this weed ?
these objects were found on the dead in mabuse 's house , sir
and hawasch is dead ... and fine
it 's the key ... ... to hawasch 's counterfeiting plant he may have taken refuge there --
take over the bank , dr. mabuse

this isn 't my house or my wife

north pole 3 miles south
sardines
wake up the movie 's over
stop it
enough
i will hear no more
it 's disgusting , appalling
but yet ... i who thought it up , hatched it out in nights , in nights ... ah
you do not know
for you it 's a game spicing what else life offers you willingly
but to me ! a thirsty one
one who is at the point of pining away ... mocked , harassed , abused by tortures which
the devil ! the guardians of order are on watch and full of ambition
behind the doors the bribed servants are lurking
- in the gardens henchmen are hiding
- you exaggerate , my friend
scruples too profound are really out of place
the fact that we are not satisfied with peasant girls and maidens , with merchants ' daughters and hussies , that we choose the finest and prettiest , is a proof of our taste
what was the watchword you gave us some weeks ago
beauty be prey of the strong
all splendour of the world succumb to the power of mind
and the conqueror 's glory shine brighter
and penetrate deeper , more painfully into the souls
than the brilliance which merely dazzles the eye
- lt 's true
- thus you spoke
- and since then
- what you created you shun
you even avoid us
none of the clandestine festivities has welcomed you
just because a few fathers wring their hands and a few mothers cry heart-rendingly
just don 't think the beauties themselves are angry with us
yesterday alissa , the little jewess , you should have seen her face
and the amazing daughter of biparetto the poet , really , she was lovely
we snatch them from their lovers ' arms heavy with everyday burdens
the misunderstood woman weeps not for the husband inexperienced in love
out of cramped rooms into wide , mystic spaces
all fairy tales come to life , all dreams of secret nights
dreams of the orient , they come true
what no one admits and everyone longs for suddenly is reality
quite so , quite so ... lt is convincing
but in one point , pardon me , for me it 's not quite right
you always only speak about yourself who are good-looking and endowed with charm , and you forget me , the cripple
if he came to the festivities , as you demand , he would spoil them ... and instead of lust horror would pave its way
my friend , it seems to me that you overrate enormously the way women feel about beauty
there were spring nights
through open windows it came in , dancing
all sensuous magic , scent of flowers , heavy and inebriating
and i had to leave , tossed by a fever , out into lonely lanes
and i searched for a strumpet , a really depraved one
spoke to her , offered her gold , a lot of gold , still i felt like the beggar asking for alms
by the light of the street lamp she looked me up and down with eyes ... a smile
so humiliating that my blood ran cold
there the gold had an effect
on coloured lips its blaze reflected my misery 's dreadful need
lascivious words promised agreement , but i didn 't have the strength to spit at myself and to desecrate the spring night
my lord , the notary
- for goodness , alviano
- you 're capable of
what 's the notary supposed to do
don 't worry
would you ask him to be patient for a short time
what for
what 's your plan
i forgot to confide it to you
my island elysium , with all its buildings , fountains and resplendent gardens , with all its miracles of art unheard of and rare treasures of generous nature
as a donation i left it for perpetuity to the city
you 're out of your senses
you don 't know what you 're doing
your life 's work
you spent half your fortune on it ; you wasted it , thoughtlessly
tomorrow evening , after dusk , in the presence of the senate and the podestá , i 'll officially announce it
to the people
gentlemen , you are invited
but , for goodness , do you forget ... i considered everything
you hand us over
the access to the underground hall ... lf you fear discovery , avoid it from now on
but excuse me now
i await the town councillors and , together with the notary , i must lay down the wording and articles of the donation
- hello
vitelozzo
- l am late
- we see ! - and out of breath
my friends
what 's up
i am bewildered
sancta maria , what happened
- deeply moved
- oh , god
unhappy one
by such beauty
- ah
- l thought so
- a woman
- of course
- no
- a goddess
- an angel
- a flower
- we know this
- please , be quiet
where did you see this beauty
i came past the town hall when the city elders drove up in their coaches for some festivity
maybe there is ... what do you think ... ln one of them , listen
my greetings , gentlemen , and thanks that my modest home has been honoured by such distinguished guests
your modest home
o noble sir salvago , you are too unassuming
the splendour of the rooms we walked through is unequalled in all of genoa
your compliment makes me happy
but please permit
here are my friends , the best of genoa 's aristocracy
you will recognize the names of illustrious descents
this is my only child , my beloved daughter carlotta
i am afraid , sir , maybe you find her too liberal-minded
she has , to my regret , a low opinion of social rules
the admiration of your generosity and a very special request to you , she ... i bid you welcome and , if i had the privilege to fulfil the young lady 's desire , i would call myself lucky
but now , if you allow , we , delegated from the senate
want to bring to you the gratitude and the joyful amazement of the noble assembly
your document announces a donation to us , so great and important , so unexpected and seldom these days
it 's hard for the citizen to preserve his paltry possessions
gold he arduously worked for runs through his fingers like water , and yet ... taxes increase even more
we endured it , mostly patiently and grumbling but rarely , since the treasure of our family 's sanctity remained to us and the belief in our madonna
but there it breaks in like a wolf into the flock and robs us of our wives and kidnaps our daughters and without defence , without help
but forgive me , sir , to complain to you about our sorrows was really not our delegation 's intention
for the first ray of light , after scared days , we have to thank you
the island 's auspicious name , for us it augurs well
do you remember , signorina , a rider this morning , his black horse took fright at the sight of the coaches
the duke adorno ... right of objection ... we 're dependent
what could he object
the rider looked into two sparkling eyes and , confused by them , he forgot to rein in the horse and nearly made an unwilling bow to the beauty , so that was you
- l was very amused
- you are cruel
and if , by falling off his horse , an arm or leg were broken
a glance from my eyes , isn 't it worth it for you
i 'd gladly give my life for you , yet
and if this were just what i wanted
you are so great , so mighty and strong , so far above me ... i have to stretch myself , look , just to look into your eyes , oh , so sure of victory
and i 'd like to see you small and low and poor , far beneath me , reachable to my feet
the dead are poor
but dead and mute
i love the soul that fights and struggles , that sacrifices itself and suffers for love 's reward
if you 're dead one day , what use is my love to you then
have you gone mad , young lady
the answer ... i will think about it
and i will answer you tomorrow
- listen
- we 're in danger
he is to hand us over to those lousy citizens
- the access to the underground hall
- by madonna
- we must stop it
- let me go
talk to adorno
do what you want , but leave me out of it
- but you ... one word
- l know nothing , i want nothing , i am in love , i love
do you hear
the plague upon you
that 's settled then
you 'll give us one more day
the senate will request the duke 's permission first
and tonight you will be my guest
as now you are mine
i beg my noble guests not to disdain my invitation , just a simple meal
signorina , your arm
you 're highly amusing
- sir alviano , really
- do you feel better then
i was scared ; suddenly you reached for your heart
- ah , little one , i am as fit as a fiddle
but did my father not tell you about a request
yes , indeed
so quickly you forget such important things
- no , but
- well , you see ... in front of the people it wouldn 't have worked
and as all my winks , my furtive signs , my asking whether you possessed a painting or a rare sculpture to show me , as all this didn 't help i had the idea
you must take me for a dolt , ignorant of life , naive and silly
ah , indeed
yet i rarely have the pleasure to associate with pretty women ... that 's why that ... do you understand
i understand
but listen
i paint
yes , really. don 't look so amazed
i do paintings
animals and men , trees and lakes ... the sky , the light ... but i like best painting souls
and you can
i mean , do you succeed in painting souls
i don 't know whether i can , and if i fail then it seems to me it 's not always my fault
you hardly find models
only once it seemed to be successful
the picture appeared , so wondrously fine
just an ugly shadow between chin and mouth
look there ... and ponder and try as i would , it appeared again and again
already i thought it gone and banished for ever. there , all of a sudden , insidiously it crept out of the brushes and took root
this picture i gave up
a long time i didn 't attempt anything
but you ... you i 'd love to paint
me
damn it , are you out of your wits
i see
it had to happen
i really thought you took me seriously , you were different from the others , the snakes with gentle faces , with enticing eyes and hearts like devils
but just now i 've seen it : the same look
oh , goodness , collect yourself
perhaps as a fool in a painting among pretty men and women , an effective contrast , with a fool 's cap , the hump would fit in quite well , for the people to jeer at for all time
hush now
don 't forget that you are speaking to a lady
you do me wrong
hear me out
where the town widens and the view opens on to the countryside
there i have a cottage for a studio
early in the morning , the lanes and squares still deserted and empty , when the wan morning light is lapping around the canvas , colourless and soft
then to me it seems the right time for work
a road goes past my cottage , lined by tall cypresses
you know it well
you often walked on it
shy and bowed down , lost in thought
suddenly suspiciously watching the windows , whose curtains hide the observer
but you did not see her
then arose , purple glowing , veils shimmering in a thousand colourings , shining mists like eerie heralds came along , announcing its approach : the sun
and a second miracle took place
i saw the small , wretched wanderer raise his head
every muscle tensed up in the frail body
the arms raised up into the sky
thus he walked into the glare , towards the sun
and i saw him becoming taller and taller , the figure was growing enormously
my heart was beating
thus i was painting you , signor alviano
thus i was painting your figure
walking towards the sun
but still i need the face and still i need the drunken eye
in which all beauty will be reflected
i am ashamed ... i don 't know ... pardon me ... i have never felt like this in my life
will you come to my studio so that i can complete the painting
i 'll be glad to come
he 's playing cat and mouse with us
he has become far too mighty , the noble sir
his last triumph over branciforte went to his head
the people have spoilt him
- after all , they are indebted to him . - they pay him
a noble mercenary , nothing more
- how are things going
- he didn 't say
not for and against
on the one hand it would be welcome for the people of genoa , on the other hand the aristocracy would regret if it were to lose a valuable property
his heart would beat for the people , would decide in its favour
but fairness and consideration for his friends would call him for caution , he ought to think it over and discuss it and similar catchphrases
with all his heart he envies us the donation
he detests the whole affair
the man of the day is alviano salvago
the whole town is praising his name
my daughter carlotta , who is not easily conquered , spoke of him often , imagining his character
now he has taken her by storm
duke adorno ought to be wary
he ought to be wary , duke adorno
do you hear it
- this is the public mood
- does the mob frighten you
you spoke differently yesterday
well , yesterday
don 't remind me
do you speak to your friend like this
excuse me
but isn 't it enough that i disdain myself
is your mockery supposed to turn a knife in my wounds and my friends ' laughter to drive me mad
what ails you , tamare
i do not recognize you
the most brilliant gentleman of my court , like nobody else honoured
beloved , idolized by the women , constantly in the mood for the most incredible pranks
there are people who only see the light and darkness is alien to them
i was one of that kind
life seemed to me a source of constant joy from which i drank with thirsty gulps , careless , without thinking
when i stretched out my hand , i held the rose , drew in its fragrance and pulled the petals off
when i dropped to the ground , i fell softly on moss , thorns shunned me as well as sharp stones
when a friend poured out his heart to me i heard him perfectly well , but i did not understand him
and now i have experienced at once all torment of hell , humiliation and disgrace
explain yourself
beautiful as the daylight , but not of equal rank with me
- a bourgeois child . - well
and then
when i spoke to her the first time i think i did not understand her right
she asked for a sacrifice as a pledge of my love
but what she desired
a lot of nonsense , madness , born at that moment i tried to understand , to interpret following the rules of courtly manners
after a night of battling i thought i 'd found it and mounted my horse , free and proud like a god , my filled heart puffed up with noble feelings
and i rode through the town and , lost in dreams , i drew up the courting and i saw the beauty flush happily , stunned and moved by the honour
a count andrae vitelozzo tamare offers heart and hand
you are really mad
be patient , duke
when i stood before her , like the first time , at once i fell in despair
the strange look in her eyes , her cool and amazed smile confused me
but to guard timid heart i behaved haughtily , arrogant and gruffly , i talked about the sacrifice i would make for her more evil than self-mutilation and death
and since i finally got her "; "; no "; "; , i completely lost the remnants of my senses
i threw myself at her feet , about my possessions i wildly talked gibberish
clasping her knees i implored her for forgiveness and mercy
tamare , pull yourself together
do you hear , vitelozzo
who is this woman
the podestá 's daughter , carlotta
ah
an important painter once mentioned her name to me as that of a rare talent
i 'd like to warn you for some reasons , but i know the futility of such an action and how he who warns is detested by him who loves unfortunately
that 's why i prefer helping you instead of giving advice to you
ah , if you could ... i will court for you
you don 't know this woman
but i know women
that 's why i hope for you
but promise me one thing
if i bring back a bad message , if i return with empty hands , then do not rage against yourself and me , be strong , don 't despair , shake it off and forget this woman
listen , duke , i want to forget her
i want to forget her
but first she has to be mine
not until i have drunk the breath of her mouth and my hands are soaked with the scent of her hair , not until this woman , if she refuses to be my wife , has been my whore
that 'll stir up bad feelings
we are bound by law and order like everybody else
don 't forget
my friends sent me to appeal to you
you may prevent that alviano 's island , elysium
- pass into the town 's possession
- damn it , what has salvago , what has the island to do with your heinous intrigues
on that island an artificial grotto makes wonderful rooms accessible
especially created for love 's celebrations
when you enter the grotto , a blue light dazzles your eyes
heavy fragrances confuse your senses , crimson flames , flaring up like visions , distant music and soft singing lure you deeper and deeper
a narrow path leads to the cave 's entrance , hidden by shrubs of roses
but if someone discovers the grotto 's secret then we are lost
does salvago know about your doing
salvago , ha ha
a whim of nature , if you like , a strange caprice
genoa 's ugliest man is the creator of this adventure
of this materialized idea of beauty
and he himself ... he himself keeps away
maybe he has regrets
but i don 't understand it
the torches ' glow gilds everything
in the orgy 's frenzy ugliness becomes beautiful , and beauty becomes ugly
the contrasts vanish in the rapture
and this fool salvago , after he cultivated on his land blooms of vice and poisonous plants of sin ... he gives up the land and himself and you
he warned us
yet he did not consider how difficult it is to control passion , once it is unbridled
that is my curse : your immoderation
your unbridled passion compels me to actions i condemn
i will rescue what can still be rescued
i will keep my promise to you because your love keeps you from the company of miscreants and because of our friendship since youth
beware , vitelozzo , you have been warned of violence
salvago ought to restrain his urge for donation for a long time
this benefactor of people , he will obey , or woe to him and woe to you all
our times are full of strange things
i knew a woman , like me she learned to paint at the antwerp school , she painted hands
fine , slim hands with delicate blue-veined structures , rough and strong fists of men
a woman 's hand with rings , voluptuous and tender , with nails , pointed and rosy , flashing like drops of pale blood
there i saw a hand which dug its nails in healthy flesh and another plucked with gentle fingers a twig , growing out of green bushes
but the oddest thing was one painting
a hand , waxen and pale , pale as death , with weird long and skinny fingers
it was grasping something you could not see
only a faint reddish gleam penetrated the eerie fingers , but this glow was like a silent dirge
like a suppressed moaning cry , like a scream , restrained and in mortal fear
like a restrained cry for release
but , the painting 's meaning
the poor one probably never felt what inspires artists to great works
the happiness of love or the ardent desire for it
she may have been anxious that once on her path of life she might encounter an event , some sensuously intoxicating charm to which she would surrender
how strange , fear of happiness
the driving force of this poor life was greed for fame and the fountain from which it was nourished was pain
not mentally , a physical pain
your hand , signorina , is not as steady as your voice , if you want to paint
no
you are wrong
my hand is quite steady and the story soon comes to an end
my friend suffered from her heart since her youth
all too often it would beat too passionately and sometimes she felt as if a merciless hand clutched at the twitching thing and squeezed it , dreadful and aching
so that it may come to rest
this hand , this cruel hand
she painted and her pain , too
even though you deny it , you are deeply moved , so it really touched you
i loved her
so she died
i think she is still alive
tell me of your youth or why you are so gloomy and in such a bad mood today ... or rather why your eyes so fearfully evade mine
what have i done ? are you angry with me
signorina carlotta , if this is nothing but a game for you , the pleasure of playing around or even worse , then you are , despite your sweet face and your voice which sounds like a message from heaven , a devil
why should i who am so good to you be as vicious and evil as you describe me
i implore you , don 't be angry with me
just have some patience with me
i don 't understand : it is like a dream and i fear
no , do not fear
you are a man and totally without any self-confidence
is it so unthinkable that a woman should find herself in love and friendship for you
ha ha
the old story
but the way you look , with eyes whose glow alone is promise
and when your mouth smiles i feel as if on earth there were nothing that is named "; "; friendship "; "; , as if this word , this miserable word , were an absurdity , a lie and disgrace
and if it were more
i do not say it is
should there be on this earth among millions of beating hearts not to be found one that strives for you in love
for me ... me who hates himself , who flees from himself , who banished the mirrors out of his rooms
a fool you are
who like nobody else clings to that which slips away like a day in may
this bit of beauty which leaves us women when the first furrow is on its way
we are scarcely conscious of spring , when buds turn to fruit
the leaves wither and fall
and this should be the one thing
did you never go out on a sunny day , gloomy and sad , without knowing why
and not even the most outstanding person , not the most flourishing tree could rescue you from your anxiety
and some other time , on rainy days , did it not make you happy , even overjoyed , to see an old , lonely man , wrinkled and ugly , who went on his way and looked at you with naive eyes
but if , on a glorious day , in a bed of the loveliest flowers , you were to find a grim monster which put you in a bad mood
but i notice one thing
you evade me , once with looks , now with words
but i have to tell you
carlotta , consider
you shall know that i love you
carlotta
for god 's sake , signor , how you do stare at me
there , take my hands , kiss them quickly
but let me go on working
i need your eyes for my painting
thus they are right for me
carlotta
beloved
i beg you , do not speak
just look at me just straight , look deeply into my eyes and think about beautiful things , that i am your sun that chases away all darkness from your life with streaming light
for god 's sake , carlotta , i must at your feet
i am happy beyond words
i beg you , stay
just look at me and consider that never again will you be lonely and unloved despite your ugliness
see how calmly i say the word which tormented you for so long
now it 's over
since it 's a word ... and a concept
nothing more
but you must be good to me , alviano , and tender , my dear
because i am quite a fragile toy
carlotta
that 's it , it 's finished
now come and hold me
i am exhausted , yet you must
for all saints ' sake
dear , what happens to you
you sweet , poor one
you loveliest one
you gave life to me , you gave back to me the belief in god and mankind
i want to consecrate to you all i have
i want to spread myself out beneath your feet
i want to be infinitely good to you and tender
lady
duke adorno
the duke , what on earth can he want
please tell him to wait
since yesterday i have been hearing voices everywhere
singing in the air and murmuring in the bushes
carlotta 's silvery laugh a while ago , but probably it was a delusion
ah , sir , how changed and happy i am since the day you first entered my house
your daughter , so soon to be my wife , how beautiful beyond words she is , so full of sincere kindness
but you are reserved
what troubles you , podestá
i am bewildered and dazzled
what you have just shown me , it is incredible that the brain of a single man should have thought up this realm of magic
many people helped me
the artists were active
i only contributed the yearning
- but where is carlotta
- come on , let us look for her
did you not hear
they are looking for you , carlotta , and you hide yourself in the shadows. then you run away from your fiancé
don 't think badly of me , duke
after all i don 't know what happens to me
yesterday when i answered you "; "; no "; "; for count vitelozzo i felt proud and secure , grand and joyful
but yet , since i finished the painting , which pleased you so much
the portrait of alviano
it seems to me as if something had grown weary within me , as if my love were no longer the same
not poorer , don 't get me wrong
but as though now he had given me his all , his everything and as though i had nothing ... nothing more to expect
and further ... yet i don 't know if a woman 's conflicting feelings are of interest to you or whether they provoke your scorn , duke
pray , trust me , how true and authentic you are
signorina
i came to this island full of secret fear
as if i had drunk wine , heavy and mixed with enchanting herbs , or that strange drink , brewed with the blood from the heart of a love-stricken virgin
it is the dreadful spell of beauty , normally bound , half-concealed from the senses and now raging , exposed to the daylight and lecherous eyes like a beautiful woman 's limbs , shyly covered in the years of desire
suddenly enjoying nakedness , displaying its charms for the rejoicing eyes of the loving youth
o duke , you who know life and women , you sinned against alviano , but he sinned even more against himself , because when i saw him , there , with my father , in all this splendour he created through the burning power of his mind
when i saw him , the poorest , who himself tore the kind-hearted veils in which mercy wraps us as well as the strange power which tames the senses , then i remembered the saying of this unhappy one in his sole joyful hour
but if , on a glorious day
in a bed of the loveliest flowers
you were to find a grim monster
- for god 's sake , young lady
- let me go , duke
calm down then ; the sole joyful hour , you said it yourself , he owes to you
this may console you
you shall not console me
i do not want any mercy
torture and hatred i do deserve , desperation and death
so listen to one last thing
he was not worthy and did not deserve your love
he is not the noble man you think he is
he is obsessed by evil desire and today it befalls him ... i won 't hear anything
you try to defame him , but he is noble and sublime and i am miserable and depraved
i hate myself and the world and you
only the night ... this very night i love and its shadows
then god may have mercy upon you
come now , i 'll take you to your father
go , go
ah , what a night
what a glowing summer night
i want to crawl into its dark light , dive into its shining darkness
with stars i 'll dance the summer night 's dance , but with goblins i 'll sleep in the bushes
ah , what a night
what a glowing summer night
ah , what a night
what a glowing summer night
with stars i 'll dance the summer night 's dance , but with goblins i 'll sleep in the bushes
ah , what a night
what a glowing summer night
where is my bride
has no one seen carlotta
why are you fleeing from me
no , i am not fleeing from you
you know me then
i don 't know who you are
but if it were someone who loves you , beauty
you love me
well then
but let me peep at your face to see whether your eyes are bright or dull
are you alviano
no , you aren 't
of nice build , a handsome man
o beautiful carlotta , how strangely you speak
strangely , my love
give me your hand , ah , it 's soft and hot , and it feels pleasant
do you feel my heart beating passionately
for you , my dear ! for you
but listen , young man , you hold it gently with your soft hands , you must not torment it , you clasp it , gently and softly
- the night is short , dawn is close
come on , let us hurry
- sweet is the night
- feel my heart beating
- let us hurry , the night is short , dawn is close
- for you
- for you
i hear her voice
it resounds to me from heights and chasms a thousand times
singing from the air , a mocking song from the depths of hell
her figure dances before me , peers out of bushes , here and there her dress glitters like a will-o ' -the-wisp she rushes me , uphill , downhill , into the air , into the swamps ... and yet i held her , after all she was mine
or was she not
- vivat alviano salvago
- he gave us joy
bearer of beauty
father of the people
what do you want
be silent
i am not a king
a fool , a cripple
a beggar , a monster
where is my bride
bring her to me
i will be grateful
i 'll give you all my worldly goods
then i will be prince , king , god
but give me carlotta
i will be grateful
then i will be prince , king , god
vivat alviano , apollo
the muses ' friend
crown the king
where is the crown , the crown of rosaries
this people 's friend , lift him up
crown him with roses
cheers for alviano
stop it , no , stop it
stop it , people of genoa
stop it , beguiled people
madmen you are
you crown the one who kidnapped your daughters , who seduced and abused your children , perhaps killed
what is this
what does he mean
the council of eight
dreadful
- he
- alviano
- don 't believe him
- l see
- the alberghi
- the sly dogs
- lt 's done cleverly
- these envious persons
- slander
- cheers for alviano
be quiet
silence
listen to the council of eight
through the holy council of eight , i , duke adorno , the people 's protector and loyal friend , bring a charge against the knight alviano salvago
i accuse him of kidnapping girls , of seduction and rape , committed against virgins , of procuring
- and encouragement to the same
- was there not a scream
did you not hear a scream
by virtue of our power as judges and keepers of the law we extend the charge against the knight alviano salvago and accuse him who is possessed by the evil one , who became a slave of satan and wicked demons
of having bewitched the people
we cast a ban on the island elysium
it shall be devastated by fire , as a breeding ground of vices and devilish sin
sir salvago , you
you see , it comes down to this
- they rob us
- they grudge us the joy
cursed thieves
beasts
- down with adorno
- death to the alberghi
kill the bastards
- lt 's all a lie
- defend yourself
- alviano , speak
- we believe you
we stand by you
alviano , speak
we protect you
for you
- don 't you hear it
music
- feel my heart beating
the night is short , dawn is close
cymbals , flutes , harps ... and wild singing
you see , he is obsessed , the demon speaks through him
alviano , listen , it 's a matter of life and death
they will interrogate him under torture
lead him away
stop
do not touch him
him who is silent we trust more than you who speak
he did us good
if you want to arrest him , give us proof
proof
bring along that woman
take your veil off , ginevra
ginevra scotti
for god 's sake , let me go
speak frankly and without reserve , ginevra scotti
where were you hidden , before you fled to duke adorno , seeking help
in the house of alviano salvago
- hear
- hear this
- silence
who is it
- hear this
what are you waiting for
why don 't you move
old man , have mercy and let me go
i begin to realize , terribly clearly
speak frankly and without reserve , signorina scotti
who robbed you of freedom and honour
a nobleman who called himself menaldo negroni
- ah
the alberghi
- look
- listen
yet , what about salvago
spit out the truth
old man , she is in danger , i see the correlation before me
the head of this gang of wild fellows , of noble robbers , is alviano salvago
all this was brought before the duke by count vitelozzo tamare
who spoke the name
who snatched it from my brain
it 's him
he kidnapped her
he was after her
he courted her. i know it , know it
are you raving
count vitelozzo kidnapped ginevra
who talks about ginevra
who is she
i don 't know anything about her
carlotta
you cur
you rake
you animal
if i had hold of you , i 'd tear you to pieces , you beast
come on , i 'll lead you
do you see the blue light up there
do you hear
listen
is this not music
wild and lascivious , screams and rejoicing
people of genoa
i will lead you to your dishonoured daughters
to my poor , lost bride
then i 'll justify myself to you and you shall judge
but woe to the others
woe
death upon them
you lie
you 're wrong. i say the truth
listen , it might well be that she will not wake up any more
that she will pass away into the other world
and see , for me it meant so much
i had nothing else
in my whole life this woman was the only great , the only wonderful thing
realize , if you say to me
l kidnapped her , i took her by force
l couldn 't do otherwise because i loved her ... "; "; , then i must hate you , i must curse you since you took from a miserable one like me what he possessed , and you destroyed it
but deep within me would still persist something , understand me , something like an aching consolation
but if you say to me
she gave herself to me
she , carlotta , willingly , in love
and she was happy , "; "; yes , precisely , you said "; "; happy
then , then ... then i had nothing , well , then you took nothing from me , then i am once again as miserable ... just as miserable as i was
thrown back into nothingness
even if you kill me , i know nothing else to tell you. only one thing
this woman became a slave to me from the first day i saw her , alviano , according to your saying once
beauty be prey of the strong
you fancied yourself strong , for one hour , but you were not
pleasure presented itself to you , there you avoided it , trembling and cowardly
you only saw the darkness , the shadows , danger and sin
too bitterly branded for life you became by fate broken-winged , inhibited , self-conscious
for your kind the precious flower is only living in dreams , but when she blossoms garishly and seducing by day it seems a dream to you , a vision , a nocturnal spectre
for did not , alviano , as you said , carlotta also give herself to you
why did you not take her
because , because
you devil , do not request that , before you go to hell , i reveal for all the world to see a crime
so ghastly
because i look into depths you can 't even imagine , since i am a man and you
i don 't know which one of us is looking deeper
i don 't know what is to be rated higher
a joyless life , a gradually wasting away or a death in rapture and transfiguration , in passionate embrace a blissful dying
your words ' meaning , but this is not possible
her lips asked for mercy , incoherently they stammered the old song of fearful resistance
but her eyes begged for lust
an agonizing confession escaped from her lips , fear and horror
but from her eyes , boundless , wild , sparks of roused desire were flashing
at last it forced its way
greater than you , she made herself free
the sparkling dance of her laughing eyes was joined by the inebriate song of her lips
grant death , "; "; her eyes rejoiced
- "; "; grant happiness , "; "; craved her speech
- dreadful
wretch , knowingly you have
roll your eyes , bare your teeth and clench your fists
my most blissful hour , no one can take it away from me
then say a prayer
you 're unable to get at me , what do you want
at a parish fair a hunchbacked fiddler stroke up a graceful tune
the most beautiful one of the beauties was his love
i picked her out of the dancing crowd and took her away
he rushed after me , he stood before me like this one , his features contorted , contorted and full of hate
with his fiddle i killed him
come on then , with my hands i shall strangle all of you
then die , scoundrel
who was yelling there
was it not ... my love
no , no , look at me , alviano
carlotta , beloved ... i am with you , he lied , lied , lied
away , away
a troll
a nightmare
help
ugh , how heavy this bears
and the red light
woe , woe
give me water
no , give me wine
and my love shall come , my handsome , sweet ... i want vitelozzo ere i die ... i want , i want
yes , but where is the fiddle ... at last i must go to the parish fair
and my cap , my nice cap
red with silver bells
has no one seen the cap
leave me , i must at last
wait ... what was that
there is someone lying there
good people , there lies a dead man
a presentation from a cultural and historical point of view in 7 chapters of moving pictures
benjamin christensen wrote the script and produced this film between the years of 1919 and 1921
for the photography i am grateful to mr. johan ankerstjerne and to mr. richard louw for the art direction
my main sources are mentioned in the theatre 's playbill
let us look into the history of mysticism and try to explain the mysterious chapter known as the witch
the belief in sorcery and witchcraft is probably as old as mankind
when primitive man is confronted with something incomprehensible , the explanation is always sorcery and evil spirits
in persia , the imaginary creatures depicted in the following picture were thus believed to be the cause of diseases
the english scientist rawlinson and french scientist maspero show us pictures of evil spirits , believed to have resided amongst the first civilizations
the belief in evil spirits , sorcery and witchcraft is the result of naive notions about the mystery of the universe
here we see how the egyptians perceived the shape of the world ( according to maspero
the ancient egyptians believed that high mountains surrounded land and water on all sides
the sky was made of steel and supported by strong pillars that stood on the high mountains
the stars , like lamps , hung from the sky on ropes
according to the beliefs of other ancient civilizations , the sky was vaulted and the earth shaped into terraces
the evil spirits of ancient times changed in the medieval folklore to devils , sneaking around and tempting children
the devils lived in the earth 's core
in the latter part of the middle ages the earth was considered to be a stationary sphere in the middle of the universe
above the earth and its waters -
- the medieval man first imagined a layer of air -
- then a layer of fire - - and outside the fire were the planets , moving celestial bodies
each planet was attached to its transparent , movable sphere
and outside the planetary spheres were the fixed stars arranged in a sky of their own
above it all , in the tenth crystal sphere , sits the almighty surrounded by nine choirs of angels and he is the one keeping the spheres revolving
deep down in the earth 's core lies hell , where those tempted by the devil shall suffer forever
in the upper part of the following picture
from the french historian lacroix ) the devils are stuffing the damned into large pots
a sinner is thrown straight into the fire burning under one of the cauldrons
a devil pours the nasty sulfur oozing from a horn down a man 's throat
two monsters torment some of the damned with their sharp teeth
i have found a strange old mechanical presentation of hell , which offers a good understanding of the beliefs in the middle ages
observe the eagerness with which the devils tend to the fire under the cauldrons
during the middle ages , devils and hell were considered real and constantly feared
witches were thought to have signed an unlawful pact with the devil , and therefore they were burned at the stake
the floating figure is a devil coming to get the witch by lifting her up into the air
this picture of a pyre as well as the following one are from "; german life in the past in pictures
in this image a witch is milking an ax handle
in the following image a witch has bewitched a man 's shoe
witches usually meet in councils
and after the gathering they might , for instance , sneak into a barn and bewitch a cow
the small angular symbol , noticeable under the drawing , was usually carved into the barn door as protection against witches
in this old naive drawing , a sorcerer and a witch are casting spells , setting a village on fire
witches were believed to curse people with diseases with the help of sorcerer 's powder and magic potions
notice how the sick person is laying naked in bed. that was habitual in the past
it was a general belief that the witch was naked when , at night , during the so-called witch sabbath , she danced with the devils
women who wanted to participate in the "; sabbath "; sneaked away to the sorcerer where they could have their backs smeared with "; witch ointment
the witchcraft of the ointment would allow them to fly through the air
the french doctors bourneville and teinturier gave me the following pictures of the witch sabbath a secret satanic rite to which thousands of women asserted their participation
at the sabbath witches and sorcerers first desecrate the church 's holy cross
satan gives all the participants devils ' names
and a ceremonial banquet is held
the sabbath food was often prepared from corpses from the gallows
all witches had to show the devil their respect by kissing his behind
after a merry dance with the devils , the witches fly home at the first crow of the cock
these scenes are often found on famous witch sabbath pictures from the middle ages and the renaissance

the witch chapter 2
we go now to the underground home of a sorceress in the year of the lord 1488
tonight the stars shine favorably over the gallows ' hill
ugh , what a stench
the thief 's body has been hanging too long on the gallows
when such a thief 's finger is too dried out , it can no longer lend the brew any healing power
hurry and open up , karna , so that the passers-by won 't see me
karna , can you perchance get me a love potion that has power over a pious man of the church
here , young maiden , take a potion of cat feces and dove hearts , boiled in the moonlight
a drop of this in a man 's drink will soften his heart at once
karna , can i have an even stronger potion
if the maiden wishes to drive the man out of his wits for love
i have a potion boiled in may from a young and playful male sparrow
hold your coin , maiden
first smell my ointment
this salve is good , should you wish to travel to brocken , one night
secretly smear this salve on and the pious monk might directly come to your chamber
you will fly together high up in the night and he will bestow upon you many hungry kisses
listen brother , i wonder
shouldn 't we pray before we embark in such a bold enterprise
oh holy mother , forgive us for cutting open a person 's dead body with a knife
it is not from untimely curiosity that we so badly sin
but so that the cause of many terrible diseases might be revealed to us
help
hurry
the peace of the cemetery has been desecrated by two witches
such were the middle ages , when witchcraft and the devil 's work were sought everywhere
and that is why unusual things were believed to be true
damned woman
you shall not lie here and bewitch the legs of honest people
you watch out
now your filthy mouth shall remain open for eternity
so it happens with witchcraft as with the devil
people 's belief in him was so strong that he became real
the devil is everywhere and takes all shapes
he shows himself as a nightmare , a raging demon , a seducer , a lover , and a knight
the devils ' companion can be young and beautiful , but she is more often old , poor and miserable
is it from the eternal fright of the pyre that you get drunk every night , you poor old woman of the middle ages
when the evening bell tolls in the night and all fires in town are covered with ashes , the devil fetches apelone for his adventures
high up in the air is apelone 's dream castle , and there the devil will fulfill all her secret wishes
to be continued
the witch chapter 3
in "; rites and rights in the german past "; by franz heinemann , we can observe pictures of inquisition judges at work
a woman suspected of witchcraft is thrown into the water to find out whether she is guilty or not
in "; history of customs "; , edward fuchs shows us how the accused is tied up
two executioners use oars to move the accused in the water where she has no support
if she floats , she will be pulled up and burned
if she sinks , the judges thank god for her innocence
i will now illustrate a trial for witchcraft from beginning to end taking place at the time when the pope sent traveling inquisition priests out to germany
oh , my husband could not have been struck by dizziness so suddenly , unless a sorceress had bewitched him
be comforted anna , wife of the printer , the power of lead will soon reveal it
oh , you powerful saturn , allow this lead to show if jesper the printer is bewitched
it is written here in the shape of lead that his dizziness is atrocious witchcraft
oh peter , look , where is the evil sorceress
you might see that witch , before you wish to
before i wish to
jesus ' holy cross and wounds
i did not hear you come , maria the weaver
oh , maiden , please have mercy on me , a poor woman who has to go begging from door to door
are you hungry , maria
here , eat now , if you can , in the name of jesus
watch out , little sister , watch out
that woman has evil eyes
the youngest servant of the inquisition may not exchange words with a strange maiden
how wonderful
it felt like fire when the young maiden took my arm
young maiden , you know quite well that what you 're accusing this woman of , endangers her life
swear by the cross that you are not deadly enemies
let 's go , young men , before her feet are lifted so that the evil witch won 't turn us all into mice
now you can have a scalding death , just what you deserve , you damned mistress of the devil
to be continued
the witch chapter 4
two "; honest "; matrons will change the accused in jail , so that she will not wear hidden witch powder
maria the weaver was just taken here accused of witchcraft
master , look carefully , there might be witch powder hidden in the sorceress ' hair
the suspect 's nights are now dictated by the inquisition judges
two honorable men try amiably to persuade her to confess
if she stubbornly denies her charges , they will use a kind of mental torture
woman , see here the seven holy words of jesus crucified , written on consecrated parchment
i will hang them around her neck , so that the devil will no longer help her to be silent
does she see this length of consecrated wax as corpus christi
the accused is taken backwards into the torture chamber , so as not to bewitch the judge when entering
for the last time i ask : does she want to confess her witchcraft and her misdeeds
let her suffering begin so that we might put an end to the harshness of her heart
oh , you learned men
how do you expect me to confess to that which is not true
well , rasmus the executioner
let now the evil witch 's body sting
let her catch her breath , rasmus the executioner , and loosen the screw a little at a time , as she confesses her sins
oh , learned men
i confess that i 've given birth to many children fathered by the devil
and when i gave birth , karna and all her coven helped me
if i am spared the pain , i will confess that trina has smeared me with witch ointment
oh yes , learned men , miserable me has flown through the night air to brocken on trina 's broom
and the devil 's grandmother was there with all her witchcraft
and many a woman , who had not accomplished enough evil deeds , was treated miserably by the devil
and masses spat upon all that is holy
and a meal of toads and unchristened children was cooked by karna
listen , maria the weaver , did you also see how the devil put his mark on the witches ' foreheads
oh , learned men , i saw the witches kiss the evil one on his behind
and anna 's mother , the wife of the printer , who wished me a scalding death -
- that damned woman , i saw her kissing the evil one so tenderly ... and sissel , her servant , that old fool , was also there
and elsa , who kicked me some time ago , she shall also burn at the stake
she passed martin the writer 's door one moonlit night with her sister
and they cast a spell on martin the writer with the water they threw against his door
and it was the very same night that death took martin the writer
and now i will tell you everything about the witches , who yell after me in the street where i live
to be continued
the witch chapter 5
in this way begins the endless turn of the wheels during the witchcraft era
each witch gives ten others away
the town wardens busy themselves
if you oppose the capture of a witch , you must be a witch yourself
the destiny of young anna , wife of the printer , is sealed
so now only two people are left in jesper the printer 's haunted house
during the witchcraft era it was dangerous to be old and ugly , but it was not safe to be young and pretty either
brother , help me. my thoughts are sinful
bare your body , brother
i 'll whip your sinful body and your poor soul , into faith healing
oh brother , why did you stop the beating of the scourge
now my soul will surely be damned
father henrik , brother john is spellbound
a witch appears in his cell to tempt him
and she has grabbed him by the wrist
stand up , brother , father henrik is coming
brother , you have not given the maiden away for a witch , have you
you know the punishment for those who refuse to witness against a witch
and so they fetch you too , young maiden , giving you their unfailing test
in the name of the holy trinity , if you are not a witch , you will now shed tears
see for yourself - you cannot shed tears , as you are allied with the evil one
we assume now that the young woman resists ; that no threat and no pain can persuade her to confess
i have tried to find out how the excellent inquisition judges behaved in such circumstances
and i see in front of me some scenes , which i do not find pictured too darkly here , on the white screen
wake up , young maiden
i bring you great happiness
see , young maiden , i give you your freedom if you would just show me a small favor in return
why do you taunt me , monk
what favor can a poor creature like me show you
teach me the beautiful art of making thunder with this water
if you do not want to take my word , young maiden , stand up and look out at the jail court
did the guards leave
yes , they went far away , maiden
the keys are now in my hand and i can secretly take you out through the town gates tonight
and i swear eternal silence to you , maiden , about all you will reveal about witchcraft with thunder
do you remember , maiden , that jesper , the printer 's child , is all alone in the world , without relatives besides you
oh , father henrik , see the tears of the young maiden
look , she cries , hence she cannot be a sorceress
don 't you know that witches secretly smear themselves with spittle , so that we might believe it to be tears
here , maiden , see the child who will miserably perish as a dishonorable , rejected witch 's offspring without you
stand here and listen to all the maiden 's words , so that later you may bear witness against her
and will you secretly open the jail gates for the child and me , if i speak
then i will tell you that once a traveling stone cutter told me
that when witches call for thunder , they put their hands in the water
you hardened witch
before the sun is down tomorrow , you will burn alive at the stake
and then they will burn you too , maiden , "; as edification for man , as sweet scent for god
and one pyre after another burns in the town square , until the judges will one day move on to the next town
the witch madness , like a spiritual plague , ravages wherever these judges go
in the arc of a few centuries , over 8 million women , men and children were burned as witches
to be continued
the witch chapter 6
there are witch confessions that are totally insane
many women , for instance , confess that - transformed into cats - they soiled the altar during the night , while two devils in the shape of animals stood guard at the church door
but there are also confessions , which might very well be close to the truth , namely during the times when superstition ruled
many women were burned because they confessed that they bewitched a marriage bed by "; tying knots
for each knot a pregnancy is destroyed
and the happiness of a whole house could be ruined with witch hair and metal crosses
many women have probably really used such magic tricks and believed in their destructive effects
but , if we should judge from the confessions , we must take a closer look at the props in the torture chamber
the french doctor paul regnard describes the way this collar was used
the collar was tightened with the help of four taut ropes
the wrists and ankles of the accused were tied to two iron rods screwed to the floor
when a fire bowl was put under the poor victim -
- his movements were so violent that the spikes of the collar entered his neck
doctor regnard shows another picture , which speaks for itself
it is simply called "; after the interrogation
the "; painful interrogation "; preferably began with a "; lighter "; torture
the thumbscrew , for example
one of my actresses insisted on trying the thumbscrew when we shot these pictures
i will not reveal the terrible confessions i forced from the young lady in less than a minute
in the convents during the middle ages , fear of the devil escalated into an almost hopeless despair
the pious gave themselves up to many a regrettable self-punishment
often a single nun was seized , and suddenly thereafter the whole convent was overtaken by insanity -
- a mysterious , contagious insanity
in writings that have survived to this day , these unhappy women wrote down with touching simplicity how the devil penetrated the convent
get thee behind me , satan
may all good saints stand by me
sister cecilia is conniving with the evil one
how these religious women must have suffered , before their nerves abandoned them and insanity broke out
in their biographies , this desperate cry is always found
the devil forced us into it
oh , holy mother , the evil has a terrible power
look , now he forces me into doing what i want the least
burn me at the stake , pious fathers
can 't you see what the devil forces me to do
take me
don 't you see him
the evil one stands over there and threatens me
to be continued
the witch chapter 7
we pass over the devil 's actual possessions
speaking in tongues and convulsions ) and come to present times
the majority of witches in the old days were poor women ; those who are taken in by pious organizations and nursing homes nowadays
one or more traits that might make an old woman noticeable was enough to bring her to court during the witchcraft era
let us not believe that the devil belongs solely to the past
the lovely old woman , who plays the role of maria the weaver in my film , once raised her tired face to me during a pause in the shoot -
- and said : "; the devil is real
i have seen him sitting at my bedside
with the old woman 's permission , i show here the prayer book in which a woman ( from 1921
thinks she can tell the devil by sight
the witch 's insanity can be explained as a nervous exhaustion that i will try to exemplify here
i ask my viewer to understand that in the following i let the same actress portray many different patients of related nervous disorders
i have personally known a very nervous young woman who often walked in her sleep
why did she always enact the very same thing she was most afraid she would do
like a witch forced by the devil , this woman both when sleeping and awake - gives way to a mysterious craving to strike matches. had this possession anything to do with her morbid fear of fire after one broke out in her home
she stated that she felt as if she were fighting against an unknown force stronger than her own
isn 't there something "; witch-like "; with this sleepwalker , who moves through the slumbering household with her matches
doesn 't she remind us of the nun , who walks through the chapel with her knife , forced by the devil
this poor woman , also in a bewildered condition , does during her sleep just what she fears the most
these possessions - these somnambulistic , dazed conditions - are consistent with the nervous diseases we call hysteria
and there are still more connections between the medieval witch and the modern hysterical person
we remember for instance that the witch received nightly visitations by the devil
today it is not the devil , but rather a famous actor , a popular clergyman or a well-known doctor , who disturbs the calm of the night
the hysterical person will undoubtedly say that these celebrities come to her through the wall or window
notice how consciously this unconscious woman holds onto her bed
a person afflicted by hysteria always displays some artificial mannerisms
in the middle ages it was believed that during the sabbath the devil put some invisible marks on the witch 's body , where all sensitivity vanished
the executioner often found insensitive areas on the back of the accused
i see clearly that you are a witch
you do not even feel the master 's instrument on your back
today , this strange insensitivity is considered a symptom of hysteria
no sir , i do not feel you touching my back at all
yes , it is as i thought ; your daughter is suffering from hysteria
from what you told me , i must strongly recommend that we detain your daughter for the time being in my clinic
it would be a pity if your daughter were to have an unpleasant exchange with the police
poor little hysterical witch
in the middle ages you were in conflict with the church
now it is with the law
i ask you to step into my office
or do you prefer that i call the police
your name
do you have a card
your address
do you have a telephone in your home
thank you , that 's fine
you can leave
i will contact you later
if my family learns about this , i will be forcefully detained
i beg you to understand that i am an unhappy , sick person
i do not know what i am doing
i have not been able to live with this persistent fear during the war
i am a broken person
it is as if an unknown power compels me to commit this terrible theft
look here
i just stole this little , expensively bound russian book
what shall i do with it
i do not know a word of russian
my husband died in the war , and i have not been the same since
i promise not to pursue this matter , but i have to ask you never to visit my store again
centuries have passed and the almighty of medieval times no longer sits in his tenth sphere
we no longer sit in church staring terrified at the frescoes of the devils
the witch no longer flies away on her broom over the rooftops
but isn 't superstition still rampant among us
is there an obvious difference between the sorceress and her customer then and now
we no longer burn our old and poor
but do they not often suffer bitterly
and the little woman , whom we call hysterical , alone and unhappy , isn 't she still a riddle for us
nowadays we detain the unhappy in a mental institution or if she is wealthy - in a modern clinic
and then we will console ourselves with the notion that the mildly temperate shower of the clinic has replaced the barbaric methods of medieval times
nathan the wise , only one copy has been found. it was found in gosfilmofond , in moscow , under the title "; conquest of jerusalem . "; in 1997 , the munich film museum obtained a copy

and tints were restored according to the conventions of the 1920s. nathan the wise

the war fanned from east and west among the people
after besieging jerusalem for months , saladin gave the order to attack
the holy sepulcher calls you into the final battle. do not forget that saladin has sworn to put to death every templar knight
with the capture of the castle of the templars he had broken their last resistance
the jerusalem christians remained at the mercy of the victor

there will be no leniency for the knights templar , who will suffer at our nefarious ends
we guarantee to the christian patriarch of jerusalem the right to deliver justice hereinafter on christians remaining in the city , according to civil and canonical law

father , my father
saladin
you give me life. thank you for my life
thoughts about her wonderful salvation filled with fearful dreams
i have seen him again , my guardian angel , and he told me to give thanks to god
i don 't want to have anything to do with you and yours
where is recha
it would be easy for a few valiant men to take saladin 's life ... so says the patriarch
think of your brothers , the templar captives ... so says the patriarch
i owe saladin my life ! should i take his ? never
al-hafi , a dervish
i saw an angel , face to face
she still longs for him
her savior was a templar knight pardoned by saladin
go , invite all the poor to celebrate with me a feast of thanksgiving
who is the party for
for your angel , recha
nathan cordially invites you
to a feast -- music , dance and recha await you
he said he would not come to the home of a jew
even though saladin 's coffers were empty
he continued to feed the poor
you dole out miserably
only a beggar knows how to feed a beggar. change clothes with him
he is not to blame
nathan is giving a feast for the poor
is he so rich
bring the jew here
he shall fill my empty coffers
give me this coat for recha
she wants to go down on her knee to thank her savior
nathan , i am ashamed you misunderstood me a moment ago
saladin orders you to come right away
he threatens disaster otherwise
hasn 't he pardoned you , and though you pardoned me seven times over
what if i love him
my heart has a strange peacefulness
new crusaders have landed in akkon. prepare the standard of the prophet
nathan has appeared
bringing pots of coins to the treasure chamber. bring the three greatest
let me return to my desert
i am afraid i will forget how to be a man as long as i am here
the true king is really a beggar
your name is nathan ? nathan the wise
of these three religions only one may be true
decide , oh wise one
princess sittah , restore nathan to us
how much is nathan worth
a ring
nice rock
how do i say
the poor call him the tears of god
before i answer your question about the true religion , may i tell you a story
a man once lived in the far east and possessed a valuable ring
the stone ring had a secret power of ... making someone at peace with god and man
so he left the ring to his beloved son and decided that it should be passed on over the course of generations , it came to the father of three sons for him , each was as beloved
in order not to offend any of his children , the father created two other rings , each exactly alike , and gave one to each child in secret and blessed them
just as the father was dying , the children arrived , each with his ring , to claim the estate
more tests were made , but they failed to find the authentic ring. as the true faith
so the brothers went to court , swearing to the judge that each had received the true ring from his father
the wise judge said , "; the real ring has the power to make men at peace
that must be decisive ...
check each one and the power of his ring in the spirit of noble competition . "; "; whoever holds the highest good
love of mankind
has the true ring
therefore , the sultan , whoever acted on the words of that wise judge , has the true religion
the ransom of the poor for the rich
give me the ring
every time i see true love of mankind , without prejudice , i will remember what god gave me
fourth act
these are troubled times
my money would be more secure with you
let me thank you ! and the life of the young templar
god protect our children , leu and blanda , assad von filneck
the time has come for the truth ! we 're ready
look for a reason to strike
do you love the templar
i do not know , father
i put aside the uniform that separates us ! give me recha as a wife
i cannot give her to you ! have patience
a jew is always a jew
so listen , knight : recha is not jewish. she is a christian and nathan is not her father
take me to the patriarch
free your conscience and mine
give recha to the templar as his wife
hurry ! take these treasures to saladin
nathan the jew has a christian child despite his beliefs
i , curd von stauffer , knight of the order of the templars , have a claim against nathan the jew .
according to the rights under our charter , we demand that sultan saladin deliver nathan to our courts , to be judged according to civil and canonical law ! judge him truly
recha
recha
for your salvation , recha
you were born a christian and nathan is not your father
what brings you here , my young friend , you who are a faithful likeness to assad
before you , the patriarch of jerusalem , appears the noble curd von stauffer
knight of the order of the templars , who has made a claim before this assembly against the jew , nathan and nathan gave all this money for your life
according to the rights under our charter
you must now make you own way to the end of this matter
you yourself must put nathan in prison
my father , nobody is going to separate us
according to our charter rights , which saladin granted us after the capture of the city , anyone who has a claim against a jew may have the patriarch judge him according to civil and canonical law
if we are wrong , forgive us for our love
fifth act
war , saladin ? remember the ring
sentencing according to civil an canonical law
the jew will be burned and his purported daughter will be sent to a convent
i once served as a squire to a knight
read his last message
letter &#93; konrad von filneck to assad , duke of schwabia
in the hour of death , i ask you in the name of jesus christ to remember your promise to rear my dear son , leu von filneck ,
the knight , leu von filneck , asks for an audience
clemency for nathan
my life in exchange for his
in what name do you ask for clemency
letter &#93; konrad von filneck to assad , duke of schwabia
and that god will reward you
have mercy on my father
take him to the prison with the other templars , and take this girl to nathan
have confidence in me
does not your ring teach you to be at peace with god and man
sixth act
return immediately to jerusalem
the templar knights are marching on jerusalem
the patriarch asked the sultan saladin to put his stamp on the decision of the ecclesiastical court
invite the patriarch and his entourage tomorrow to attend the execution of the sentence in the citadel
the day of the trial
sultan saladin asks you to attend the execution of the sentence at the citadel
he will give you a hostage for every man that goes to jerusalem
prepare to receive your judgment
my word requires me to pronounce a terrible sentence upon you
if i do not , these walls will be stained with blood tomorrow
war or peace
you yourself pronounce the judgment
it is better for one man to die than all of humanity to be stricken with more hate and guilt
i 'm ready
nathan , the child that you reared in noble humanity has not been baptized
your sublime example has shown us all the path of true wisdom and love of our neighbor. you 're free
the people shall live in the future in peace and harmony with one another
that 's why we give freedom to the captive templars
no more religious hatred shall separate the peoples of east and west
we thus transfer solemnly to christianity the tomb of their redeemer as a place of eternal pilgrimage
blanda von filneck , you are my brother 's daughter
leu von filneck , now comes the hardest test of your heart
this is your sister

chronicle of the great death in wisborg anno domini 1838 , by
nosferatu
does this word not sound to you like the midnight cry of the deathbird
take care in saying it , lest life 's images fade into shadows , and ghostly dreams rise from your heart and nourish themselves on your blood
long have i contemplated the origin and recession of the great death in my hometown of wisborg
here is its story
there lived in wisborg hutter and his young wife ellen
why did you kill them ... the lovely flowers
not so fast , my young friend
no-one outruns his destiny
there was also a property agent by the name of knock- the subject of all sorts of rumours
one thing was certain : he paid his people well
count orlok
- his lordship ... from transylvania ... wishes to acquire a beautiful home in our little town
you could earn a nice bit of money of course the price is a little effort ... some sweat and perhaps ... a little blood
he wants a fine , deserted house
that house ... directly across from yours
offer him that one
travel quickly , travel well , my young friend , into the land of the spectres
i 'm travelling far , far away into the land of thieves and spectres
so hutter placed the anguished girl in the care of his friends , the rich shipowner harding and his sister
be at ease
and young hutter travelled many dusty roads , but at last the peaks of the carpathians loomed before him
the horses strained harder
quickly ... something to eat -
i have to get to count orlok 's castle
you shouldn 't go any further now
the werewolf roams the woods
of vampyres gastlie spirits , bewitchments and the seven deadlie sins
from belial 's seed sprang the vampyre nosferatu , who doth live and feed on the bloode of humankind - beyonde deliverance he doth dwell in gastlie caves , sepulchres and coffins , filled so with god-curst earth from the fields of the black death
of vampyres gastlie spirits , bewitchments and the seven deadlie sins
onward
the sun is setting
offer what you like ! we 're not going any further
we won 't go on
it 's frightening beyond the pass
no sooner had hutter stepped across the bridge , than the eerie visions he had often told me about seized hold of him
you have kept me waiting - waiting too long . -
now it is nearly midnight
the servants are sleeping
end of the 1st act
nosferatu 2nd act
you have hurt yourself
precious blood
shouldn 't we like to sit together a bit , dear friend
it is a while still till sunrise - and in the daytime i sleep , my dear fellow , i sleep the deepest of sleeps -
just as the sun rose , the shadows of the night withdrew from hutter as well
my dear
my dearest
grieve not that thy beloved is so far away
i am plagued by mosquitoes
i already have two bites on my throat , one quite near the other , on each side
one dreams so heavily in this desolate castle , but fear not
the spectral evening light seemed to revive the shadows of the castle once more
your wife has a lovely neck
i shall buy the house
the fine , deserted house opposite yours
at night this same nosferatu doth clutch his victim and doth suck like hellish life-potion its blood
take heede that his shadow not encumber thee like an incubus with gruesome dreams
at the same hour
a doctor ... a doctor
harmless congestions of the blood
the doctor related ellen 's distress to me as an unknown illness
i know , however , that her soul that night caught the cry of the deathbird -
nosferatu was already spreading his wings . -
yet with the morning light hutter set out to make sense of the horror of his nights . -
the raftsmen didn 't know what kind of unholy cargo they were conveying through the dale
end of the 2nd act
nosferatu 3rd act
he was brought to the hospital yesterday by some farmers
they said he must have fallen
he 's still feverish
nosferatu was on his way. the danger for wisborg drew nigh
the paracelsian professor bulwer , who at that time was studying the secrets of nature and their deepest unifying principles , told me the following
earth-filled coffins were to be loaded onto the double-masted ship , the empusa
the vessel 's still set for sail tonight
bill of lading
empusa
route : from galaz to wisborg
cargo : 6 crates of earth ( experimental purposes
in those days , i should note , prof. bulwer was explaining to his students the cruel habits of carnivorous plants
they observed in horror nature 's mysterious ways
like a vampire - isn 't it
it seems that the approach of the strangler , nosferatu , already compelled the property agent knock into his shadow
the patient admitted yesterday is going mad
blood is life
blood is life
and this one here a polyp with tentacles transparent
almost incorporeal almost but a phantom
ellen was often seen on the beach within the solitude of the dunes. yearning for her beloved , her eyes scanned waves and distance alike
my dear
my dearest
grieve not that thy beloved is so far away
i am plagued by mosquitoes
i already have two bites on my throat , one quite near the other , on each side
one dreams so heavily in this desolate castle , but fear not
no i must go
by the shortest route home
a plague epidemic has broken out in transylvania and the black sea ports of varna and galaz
all victims exhibit the same peculiar stigmata on the neck , the origin of which still puzzles the doctors
the dardanelles were closed to all ships suspected of carrying the plague
a sailor 's fallen ill below deck
he 's delirious
it spread through the ship like an epidemic
the first stricken sailor pulled the entire crew after him into the dark grave of the waves
in the light of the sinking sun , the captain and ship 's mate bid farewell to the last of their comrades
i 'm going below
if i 'm not back up in ten minutes
the ship of death had acquired its new captain
end of the 3rd act
nosferatu 4th act
it 's quite difficult to say how , despite his depleted strength , young hutter succeeded in surmounting the obstacles on his voyage home - - meanwhile , nosferatu 's deadly breath swelled the sails of the ship , which flew on toward its destination with ghostly haste
i must go to him
he 's coming
the master is near
the master is near
long have i pondered why nosferatu was said to have travelled with earth-filled coffins
i found it recorded that vampyres can only draw their shadowy strength from the accursed earth in which they were buried
thank god ... you 're safe
all 's well now
looked over everything
not a living soul on board
varna - 12 july
crew - minus myself as captain : one helmsman ; one ship 's mate
second day - 13 july one sailor ill with fever

proclamation
it is hereby decreed that the honourable magistrate of this town forbids the populace to transport the ill or plague-stricken to the hospital , lest the plague spread through the streets
end ofthe 4th act
nosferatu 5th act
hutter made ellen swear not to touch the book which had frightened him with its visions . -
yet she could not resist its bizarre attraction
at night this same nosferatu doth clutch his victim and doth suck like hellish life-potion its blood
take heede that his shadow not encumber thee like an incubus with gruesome dreams
wherefore no other salvation is possible , but that a maiden wholly without sin maketh the vampyre forget the first crow of the cock. would that she give freely of her blood
this is what i see - each evening
fear lurked in every corner of the town
who was still well
who already ill
i 'll run over there quickly
i 'll fetch sievers
wherefore no other salvation is possible , but that a maiden wholly without sin maketh the vampyre forget the first crow of the cock. would that she give freely of her blood
the panic-stricken town was looking for a victim
it was knock
someone saw him
he ran outside
he strangled the custodian
he strangled him
the vampire
i love you
bulwer
fetch bulwer
knock has been captured
the master ... the master
the master ... is ... dead
witness the miracle on the heels of the truth
at that very hour , the great death came to an end , and as if confronted by the victorious radiance of the living sun , the shadow of the deathbird was dispersed

the reconstruction was carried out in 2002 / 2003 by luciano berriatúa and camille blot-wellens on behalf of the friedrich-wilhelm- murnau-stiftung in wiesbaden
the basis was a camera negative and a dupe negative from the bundesarchiv-filmarchiv , berlin
most of the intertitles were obtained from the flash titles on the original negative
the missing intertitles were restored by referring to the shooting script
the newly appended titles are recognisable by way of the friedrich-wilhelm- murnau-stiftung ( fwms ) logo
the reconstruction of the hues was made possible by tinting the negatives
laboratory work
l 'immagine ritrovata , bologna
in 2008 , an export copy was discovered in the cineteca nacional de chile in santiago
in 2013 , the tinting was revised and inconsistencies in the reconstruction rectified , for the 2k digital version

direction
f. w. murnau
first act
what were you just thinking about , lorenz
about my former life
write the story of your life in this book , which father himself bound for you
do you think the memory will be less agonising then
i , former convict lorenz lubota , hereby write down , as my dear wife marie wills it so , the story of my guilt and my atonement
melanie doesn 't have any time for this - does she
call lorenz
always you with your books , lorenz
with the amount of money you earn even god doesn 't know how you could be able to afford them
just let me have my poor books , mother
at the very least they provide one with dreams of all the things one will never experience
isn 't it time for you to get to art-school , hugo
i 'll be coming home a bit later today
i want to help aunt schwabe with some accounts
i don 't want you to have anything to do with her - with that ... usurious witch
she 's gotten fat and rich off her cutthroat business
and i , i 've slaved away my whole life like a horse
the neighbours
lorenz should be getting here soon , at this point
it seems to me , my child , that you divide your day up into lorenz 's comings and goings
does lorenz know that ?
hold onto your heart , marie
once lorenz wakes up from his dream world
here are a few poems i 've done , father starke
i 'd like to hear what you think of them
well well , now you of all people are wishing to tread among the poets -
please , don 't hold me up
i have to go to work
what kind of work is it that you do anyway -
where did you get those silky rags ?
where have you been running around night after night - ?
get a grip on yourself , mother
you 're rid of me now -
i have no desire to wither away and rot in this miserable hole
i can stand on my own two feet
i don 't need anybody 's help
misery , hunger , poverty - everything 's coming down on me
and now disgrace too
can 't lorenz lubota ever get to work on time ?
the good lord in a fit of wrath made lorenz lubota town clerk
well - take care , mother
melanie ... where you 're headed ... there 's no way back
what do you want here
why are you running after our dear girl
end of the first act
second act
so , i 'm telling you , marie
this lorenz , who would have thought of it
this is more than talent - this is genius
mist - mister lubota
professor , old starke doesn 't just throw his support behind anyone , but lorenz lubota - that 's a genius
are you the one , muse , / who takes me in her service , /
and like the sphinx / tears with her claws from my breast /
my song
lorenz
are you ill ?
have you already found out -
from your sister -
how ugly ... how terribly ugly it all is -
i want to go get a little fresh air
maybe - that will put me more at ease
you , sir - man - lad , do you know you 're a genius ?
i gave your poems to a man who would consider it an honour to be your mentor
one fine day , at the hall where you were once a lowly clerk , you 'll be made an honorary citizen of our town
do you really think ... that i 'm a poet
that i could be a great and eminent man - ?
i think that now the boy realises he 's a poet , he 's losing his head
what 's the name of the daughter in this house here
i can 't give you anything more , child
i 've got nothing myself
either the money - or the pawn-ticket
rules are rules in this world
this must be your first experience with schwabe ... as you think you can persuade the old bird by pleading
you know mr wigottschinsky , lorenz - don 't you
pretend i 'm not here
act like you would in your own home
i gave a number of poems that i composed in my spare time to an excellent judge of literature - a certain mr. starke , to read
now he wants to introduce me to a well-known publisher who 's supposed to print my poems
my boy , you might very well become quite the famous man
how can an old hand such as you be so far off the mark in your judgment
the poems are nice enough ... but they are certainly not , and never will be , publishable material -
now i don 't dare go to the publisher ... with my shabby suit
considering your impending fame , you do look pretty shabby
we 'll just have to help fix that for you
the old dame seems to have taken a fancy to you
it 's usually hard to pull one over on her
i think i 'll accompany our poet to look for some new clothes
i 'm something of an expert there
will you come back again
